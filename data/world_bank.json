This component will include: civil works for widening and upgrading of approximately 400 km of existing single lane/intermediate lane national highways of Non-National Highway Development Project (NHDP) network in the project states, to two lane standards through item-rate contracts; providing supervision of quality control services, and others including costs towards land acquisition, resettlement and rehabilitation, shifting of utilities. The second component of the project is institutional development component. The project will enhance the institutional capacity of MoRTH to better manage the non-NHDP network through supporting specific intervention in five areas, viz., process improvements, network monitoring and management, financing, governance and accountability, and training. The third component of the project is road safety component. This component will pursue the objective of improving road safety through: 1) updating Indian standards and regulations related to road safety; 2) improving road accident data collection and analysis at central and state levels through implementation of the Road Accident Database Management System (RADMS) in project states; 3) strengthening road safety capacity at the central level, and 4)

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is policy support. This will support developing and implementing Renewable Energy (RE) legislation and policies to achieve cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and smooth grid integration. The second component of the project is grid integration/access and technical design. This component will consist of targeted studies to ensure improved grid integration for large-scale grid-connected RE and grid access for distributed RE; and strategic and optimal deployment of key RE technologies to enhance efficiency and reduce costs. The third component of the project is technology improvement. Under this component the technology improvements will include, but not limited to: a) increasing efficiency of existing wind farms; b) improving quality and reliability and reducing costs of off-shore wind turbine technologies; c) increasing efficiency of existing large-scale grid connected solar Photovoltaic (PV) farms; and d) possibly improving Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) domestic manufacturing capacity. The fourth component of the project is pilot demonstration.

The DPL has been prepared jointly with the European Union (EU) and the African Development Bank (AfDB), leveraging a further US$ 250 million in support of common key policy actions such as the budget, procurement and open governance reforms. The programmatic approach is warranted by the scope and depth of the government's governance reform program, the implementation of which will require time, assistance, and flexibility. This operation is complemented by the transition fund project supporting the implementation of Morocco's new governance framework. This US$ 4 million grant provides technical assistance for the implementation of structural reforms fostering public engagement; performance based budgeting and fiscal decentralization. The series adopts a holistic and integrated approach to enhance its impact. It is supporting governance reforms across the public sector covering the central government; State owned Enterprises, or SoEs and agencies, local governments as well as inter-governmental relations. The Bank has provided policy advice and technical assistance for the design of most policy measures and laws supported by this DPL, with the support from the MNA multi-donor trust fund. The transition fund governance project will support the implementation of these structural reforms. While building on the long-standing engagement with public administration reform, under the Public Administration Reform Loan (PARL) series, this program supports the concretization of the performance budgeting reform through the adoption and implementation of the new organic budget law and procurement decree.

This component will provide direct municipal grants to municipalities that are hosting the largest concentration of Syrians (i.e., weighting the number of Syrians hosted and their ratio to the host population). Reflecting the increased size of their populations, the Grants will allow municipalities to finance additional public services and programs to help improve living conditions, reduce communal tensions and enhance social cohesion for the benefit of the Jordanians and Syrians living in their jurisdictions. Finally, the second component is the institutional development and project management. This second component will finance two subcomponents: (i) subcomponent 2A - technical assistance to participating municipalities to plan, implement and manage activities funded by the Municipal Grant, as well as project management support to implementing agencies to coordinate, manage and oversee the project; and (ii) subcomponent 2B - capacity building of key Government agencies and vulnerable communities in emergency preparedness, and risk planning, management and financing.

The project has four components. The first component is support for sanitary and phytosanitary services. This component aims to strengthen the efficiency and effectiveness of sanitary and phytosanitary services in order to reduce existing obstacles to agricultural and food trade. The component will be structured into following three sub-components: (i) food safety capacity building to establish a roadmap for comprehensive reforms, including key principles for the national food safety control policy and enforcement; (ii) upgrading plant health and phytosanitary system will support upgrading the State Phytosanitary Control Services (SPCS) which is mandated to ensure phytosanitary safety on the import, production, storage, and processing of plant and plant products; and (iii) animal health and veterinary services will support the strengthening the State Veterinary Services (SVS) and promotion of a complementary private veterinary sectors as key elements being considered to provide a suitable environment for improving and securing animal production. The second component is agribusiness value chain development. This component will help develop value chains by partially financing demand-driven investment proposals. It will also support activities for improving seed varieties and quality of seeds entering the market. It has following two sub-components: (i) investment and advisory support for agribusiness value chain development to: (a) provide development support for value chain participants to assist them to establish productive partnerships and prepare sub-project proposals for funding under the project, and (b) investment support for agribusiness value chains; and (ii) seed sector development will help to build on the experience of Second Agricultural Development and Credit Project (ADCP-II) and will support the seed development chain that includes the National Research Institute for Crop Husbandry (NRICH) and its research stations. The third component is financial services to agribusiness.

Five areas of priority, or policy areas, have been identified. First, better fiscal and financial management will enable policymakers to maximize benefits accruing from increased revenues from natural resources. Second, the revenue management framework in the hydropower and mining sectors should also be clearly defined to maximize revenues accruing over time to the government for development purposes while attracting good quality investment in the sector. Third, diversification of economic growth sources through a competitive private sector outside the resource sector is critical to ensure the sustainability of growth. As the natural resource sector is capital intensive, it does not provide abundant job opportunities, as opposed to manufacturing, agribusiness or services. Diversified sources of growth are also important to reduce vulnerability to developments and exogenous shocks in narrow set of sectors. Finally, the fourth and fifth priorities for translating increased revenues from the natural sectors into improved public service delivery are a strong public sector capable of managing these revenues effectively coupled with the establishment of sustainable financing mechanisms for schools and health facilities. PRSO 9 supports the establishment of a mining revenue committee and its reporting on fiscal regime policy issues and options in the sector. In education, PRSO 9 supports making available for dissemination school based expenditure reports, to monitor spending in general and the school block grant scheme in particular." }, "project_name" : "Lao PDR Ninth Poverty Reduction Support Operation", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081fa5f95_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081fa5f95_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-OCT-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000290557_20130809110209", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000290557_20130809110209", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130711151329", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130711151329", "DocDate" : "12-DEC-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "General education sector" }, { "Name" : "Non-compulsory health finance" }, { "Name" : "Thermal Power Generation" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 40 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General education sector", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Non-compulsory health finance", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "General education sector", "code" : "EZ" }, { "name" : "Non-compulsory health finance", "code" : "FB" }, { "name" : "Thermal Power Generation", "code" : "LG" } ], "sectorcode" : "LG,FB,EZ,YZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "Percent" : 14 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Trade facilitation and market access", "code" : "49" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Health system performance", "code" : "67" } ], "themecode" : "67,27,49,40", "totalamt" : 20000000, "totalcommamt" : 20000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143025/lao-pdr-ninth-poverty-reduction-support-operation?lang=en" }

The project will support the establishment and operation of Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (NMRC), created in partnership between private financial institutions, development finance institutions, and the ministry of finance. It will issue standard corporate bonds into the capital markets and subsequently issue loans (refinance and pre-finance) to mortgage lending institutions. The second component is establishment of a mortgage guarantee product, targeted at lower income borrowers. The project will fund the product development including testing and financial modeling, and then launch a competitive process, among private or public owned nonbank financial institutions to select a mortgage guarantee agent to implement the project. The project will also provide a line of credit to the project implementing entity on account of the mortgage guarantee agent for the issuance of mortgage guarantee products to eligible lenders. The third component is Housing Microfinance (HMF). This component aims to support the development and piloting of new and or emerging formal HMF products and to demonstrate a sustainable business case for these activities. The fourth component is Technical Assistance (TA) and capacity building. The TA will be provided to support components one, two, and three. The TA will include provision of operational support to NMRC including assistance for bond issuance, mortgage lender training, mortgage consumer protections and financial literacy, housing market information, and impact evaluation of the mortgage market. TA also will be provided for HMF product development and piloting, Microfinance Banks (MFBs) staff training, consumer protection, impact evaluation, and related ancillary support services necessary for establishing sustainable HMF operations." }, "project_name" : "Housing Finance Development Program", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130911092410", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130911092410", "DocDate" : "30-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081aff444_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081aff444_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-APR-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Housing finance" }, { "Name" : "Housing construction" }, { "Name" : "Capital markets" }, { "Name" : "Vocational training" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Housing finance", "Percent" : 85 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Housing construction", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Capital markets", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Vocational training", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Housing finance", "code" : "FC" }, { "name" : "Housing construction", "code" : "YC" }, { "name" : "Capital markets", "code" : "FK" }, { "name" : "Vocational training", "code" : "EV" } ], "sectorcode" : "EV,FK,YC,FC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Land administration and management", "Percent" : 5 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Land administration and management", "code" : "83" }, { "name" : "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support", "code" : "41" } ], "themecode" : "41,83", "totalamt" : 300000000, "totalcommamt" : 300000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131973/housing-finance-development-program?lang=en" }

First, the project will improve the business climate by simplifying the processes of registering a business and obtaining a license, updating outdated legal framework governing business entry, and introducing electronic payment facilities for business and tax services. Second, fiscal transparency will be enhanced by removing legislative impediments to business and investment. Third, public financial management will improve through the creation of an independent commission for supervising public enterprises. Fourth, targeting social assistance will improve economic reform through the merging of the Social Welfare Agency and the Social Security Fund.

The Adaptation Fund (AF) was established to finance concrete adaptation projects and programs in developing countries that are parties to the Kyoto protocol and are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. On December, 2012 the proposal submitted by the International Bank for reconstruction and Development (IBRD) to the AF Board seeking access to resources in support of the 'Increasing Climate Resilience and Enhancing Sustainable Land Management in the Southwest of Buenos Aires Province' project in Argentina, was approved.

This component aims to promote further regional market integration, sector liberalization, and legal and regulatory reforms, and will include subcomponents focused on Technical Assistance (TA), capacity building, and training including the TA to assist the government with preparatory work for the submarine cable FLY-LION3 (From Comoros to Mayotte and Madagascar), including environmental studies feasibility studies and demand analysis. The second component is connectivity. This component will finance (i) membership and participation in the FLY-LION3 cable -- the link between Comoros, Mayotte and Madagascar-- under a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangement, which will ensure connectivity with LION-2; (ii) advance purchase of additional broadband capacity from East African Submarine System (EASSy), FLY-LION3 and/or LION2 and its use to provide demand stimulation measures by providing affordable bandwidth to key users such as the university, schools, hospitals, etc.; and (iii) additional measures to stimulate demand including by promoting the creation of local ISPs and establishing a carrier-independent Internet Exchange Point (IXP). And the third component is project management. This component will consist of support to finance project management costs including project coordination, procurement, financial management, monitoring & evaluation, communication, environmental and social safeguards, office equipment, incremental operating costs, and audits." }, "project_name" : "RCIP4 - Regional Communications Infrastructure Program - APL 4", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0820369b7_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0820369b7_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b082035b03_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082035b03_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130822123515", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130822123515", "DocDate" : "14-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20131017110210", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131017110210", "DocDate" : "14-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "090224b081b9a38e_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b9a38e_1_0", "DocDate" : "25-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081919e9f_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081919e9f_1_0", "DocDate" : "07-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0818fd0e6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818fd0e6_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000231615_20121213120444", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20121213120444", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000231615_20121213140130", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20121213140130", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol.", "DocType" : "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012030116305860", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012030116305860", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012022717595783", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012022717595783", "DocDate" : "27-FEB-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "000014464_2012050116574523", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000014464_2012050116574523", "DocDate" : "16-FEB-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Telecommunications" }, { "Name" : "Information technology" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Telecommunications", "Percent" : 60 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Information technology", "Percent" : 30 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Telecommunications", "code" : "CT" }, { "name" : "Information technology", "code" : "CA" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "code" : "BM" } ], "sectorcode" : "BM,CA,CT", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "code" : "25" }, { "name" : "Rural services and infrastructure", "code" : "78" }, { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Infrastructure services for private sector development", "code" : "39" } ], "themecode" : "39,40,78,25", "totalamt" : 22000000, "totalcommamt" : 22000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P118213/rcip4-regional-communications-infrastructure-program-apl-4?lang=en" }

Service improvements will depend on training both the providers and users of services to be able to tailor information more effectively to users needs. The geographical focus will be countrywide. The project will have social and economic benefits by managing risk in weather-related disasters that disproportionately affect the poor and vulnerable populations through improving forecasting, early warning systems and the observed climatology of Yemen. The project consists of the following four components: 1) the first component aims to improve climate resilience in Yemen through institutional strengthening and capacity building by provisioning of weather, climate and water services that meet stakeholders needs by creating the conditions that ensure institutional, staffing and financial sustainability of the key providers; 2) the second component aims to upgrade and expand the observations networks for meteorology, agro-meteorology and hydrometeorology, ensuring that these networks are interoperable; 3) the third component provides for the implementation of a systematic upgrade of the weather, climate and water-related end-to-end services provided to all agencies, communities and individuals; 4) and the fourth component involves program management and knowledge sharing.

The series has been prepared in line with good practice principles for development policy operations in situations of fragility. The series focuses on areas of heightened importance in these settings: (1) strengthening public confidence in government by improving the transparency of budgets and accountability of public officials; (2) building investor confidence through rapid, visible improvements in the business climate; and (3) quickly creating economic opportunities by focusing on potential sources of growth and employment, particularly on labor-intensive exports. The reforms supported by the series reinforce its cross-cutting foundation of governance, including policies to reduce corruption, enhance transparency in public service and in the exploitation of natural resources, and strengthen the oversight role of civil society. Reforms to increase the resilience of the Ivorian economy include increasing the share of revenues from the main export crop, cocoa, received by farmers. Reforms to create jobs focus on improving the business climate, raising private investment, and supporting the growth of promising labor-intensive activities in rural areas, such as cashew production and cotton cultivation." }, "project_name" : "Cote d'Ivoire PRSC 1", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130806141405", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130806141405", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120521144052", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120521144052", "DocDate" : "09-APR-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade" }, { "Name" : "Crops" }, { "Name" : "General energy sector" }, { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 40 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Crops", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General energy sector", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Industry and trade", "code" : "BT" }, { "name" : "Crops", "code" : "AH" }, { "name" : "General energy sector", "code" : "LZ" }, { "name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "code" : "AZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AZ,LZ,AH,BT,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Rural policies and institutions", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Rural policies and institutions", "code" : "77" }, { "name" : "Other accountability/anti-corruption", "code" : "29" }, { "name" : "Export development and competitiveness", "code" : "45" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" } ], "themecode" : "27,45,29,77", "totalamt" : 50000000, "totalcommamt" : 50000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127449/cote-divoire-prsg-1?lang=en" }

There are four components to the project: the first component being strengthening of marine management concept in marine protected areas. The second component is the strengthening coastal communities. This component is aimed at strengthening local communities' capacity to identify, develop and implement sub-projects aimed at: (i) reducing pressure on marine resources, and (ii) the provision of alternative livelihood income in such areas as fish processing, recreational fishing, eco-tourism and small, scale aquaculture. The third component is the regional environmental and socioeconomic monitoring network.

There are six components to the project, the first component being strengthening of state-level water institutions and inter-sector coordination. This component aims to provide support to the institutions in the state responsible for overall integrated water resources management and implementation of the state water policy. The second component is the modernization and rehabilitation of irrigation and drainage systems. The third component is the consolidation and enhancement of irrigation institutional reforms. This component will enhance the efficiency of the Uttar Pradesh Irrigation Department (UPID) and strengthen the Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) approach both in the department as well as in the community. The fourth component is the enhancing agriculture productivity and on-farm water management. This component (to be implemented directly by the Department of Agriculture) aims to improve the overall agriculture productivity and water-use efficiency at the field level. The fifth component is the feasibility studies and preparation activities for the next phase. This component is to prepare detailed surveys and designs for future third phase areas. These new areas will be identified by the Government of Uttar Pradesh and will make use of similar design principles (and the lessons learned) adopted under this second phase operation.

Most of the population is dispersed across rural areas of the archipelago, where they largely depend on subsistence agriculture. This caps food poverty rates, but exposes the population to environmental shocks. Poverty rates are higher in urban areas, where traditional safety nets are weaker and unemployment rates are high. A former British protectorate, the country became independent in 1978 and enjoyed twenty years of moderate but sustained economic growth and improvement in social indicators. A low-level conflict between 1998 and 2003, known as 'the tension,' brought the formal economy and many state functions to a halt. Real GDP per capita, which had been slowly eroding between 1996 and 1999, fell sharply between 2000 and 2002. An Australian-led and financed regional peacekeeping mission, the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI), stopped the violence and rapidly restored order and basic state functions, particularly in finance. The country has subsequently enjoyed a fairly good security situation, interrupted only by short-lived but destructive riots in 2006, mainly in the capital Honiara. RAMSI presently retains a police and military presence, as well as a large corps of civilians in advisory or in line functions, notably in the Ministry of Finance and Treasury (MoFT). Given the overall stability in the country, RAMSI will undergo a significant transition in mid-2013. Although an extensive police presence will remain to build the capacity of the Royal Solomon Islands police force, the bulk of the military component is scheduled to depart, and the advisory support will transition to bilateral programs." }, "project_name" : "Solomon Islands Development Policy Operation-2", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130808112918", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130808112918", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130422095101", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130422095101", "DocDate" : "03-APR-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 90 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "YZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "Percent" : 90 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Participation and civic engagement", "code" : "57" } ], "themecode" : "57,27", "totalamt" : 2000000, "totalcommamt" : 2000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143242?lang=en" }

This project focuses on the following geographical areas of production: the southwest around the Nawa region for cocoa, the southeastern regions of Sud Comoe and la Mé for rubber and oil palm, the central and northern regions of Hambol and Gontougo for cashew nuts, and the northern regions for cotton. Project activities are clustered around three technical components, combining value chains and geographic areas to facilitate implementation. The first component promotes a public-private partnership for sustainable cocoa development in southwest Côte dIvoire. The second component supports the expansion and renewal of village plantations of oil palm and rubber in southeast Côte dIvoire. The third component supports the cotton sector and promotion of cashew processing in central and northern Côte dIvoire. Each of the three components is similarly structured with three sub-components, namely improving access to markets, improving productivity in a sustainable way, and introducing institutional development to the value chain.

Thus the additional credit will: (a) protect financing for poverty-targeted programs; (b) support the government of Honduras in strengthening program operations and consolidating sector-level investments that are not necessarily benefitting the poor; and (c) deepen the World Banks engagement in the social protection sector." }, "project_name" : "Honduras Additional Financing Social Protection", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "IP", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130716120516", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130716120516", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000456286_20130723102411", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20130723102411", "DocDate" : "08-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081c33d59_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c33d59_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081c0f17a_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c0f17a_1_0", "DocDate" : "30-MAY-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 78 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "code" : "BS" } ], "sectorcode" : "BS,JB", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "Y", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 100 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" } ], "themecode" : "54", "totalamt" : 12300000, "totalcommamt" : 12300000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144928/honduras-additional-financing-social-protection?lang=en" }

At the Kabul and Lisbon Conferences in 2010, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Afghan government agreed that full responsibility for security would be handed over by 2014. The country now faces the prospect of a drawdown of most international military forces that so far have supported the fight against the ongoing insurgency. At the same time, Afghanistan is gearing up for a presidential election in April 2014 which many anticipate to be a difficult process given the complex political environment and challenging logistics. Despite these steps, Afghanistan will need to rely heavily on donor financing to ensure the continued provision of public services and investment through the transition period. At the request of the authorities, this Development Policy Grant (DPG) series is designed to support the government's strategy for developing greater economic and fiscal self-reliance. The reform program is ambitious, especially in light of the upcoming elections, but it is strongly supported by the government, key stakeholders and donors. This program document describes the first in a series of two programmatic grants to Afghanistan. The first operation is in the amount of US$50 million, out of US$100 million for the programmatic series. A programmatic approach is proposed to carry on reform momentum and strengthen reform incentives during times in which political incentives for reforms are typically low due to upcoming election. Moreover, lessons from other operations in Afghanistan favor a carefully sequenced and continuous reform-approach." }, "project_name" : "AF: Development Policy Prog.

This component will support a PBF pilot at the PHC level in eight rayons (or districts) in Khatlon and Sogd oblasts (regions). Under the PBF pilot, Rural Health Centers (RHCs) and their subsidiary Health Houses (HHs) will be eligible to receive a performance-based payment each quarter based on the quality and quantity of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) and Non-communicable Diseases (NCD) services delivered. The development and testing of the PBF scheme is currently being financed by a separate preparation grant from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF). The second component is primary health care strengthening. This component will aim to improve the capacity of PHC providers to deliver quality services.

The Project consists of the following five components: (i) construction of two metro stations of the Quito Metro Line One; (ii) infrastructure and equipment investment for the Quito Metro Line One; (iii) provision of train sets to operate in the Quito Metro Line One; (iv) Project Management; and (V) technical studies to support implementation." }, "project_name" : "Quito Metro Line One", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Board Summary (SU),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SU", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130806123931", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130806123931", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130709113927", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130709113927", "DocDate" : "28-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20131009163948", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20131009163948", "DocDate" : "28-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081c9e752_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c9e752_1_0", "DocDate" : "23-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081c757e9_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c757e9_1_0", "DocDate" : "17-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081bb1aa4_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081bb1aa4_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081b80ce3_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b80ce3_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130607120101", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130607120101", "DocDate" : "01-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130618113357", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130618113357", "DocDate" : "01-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130328121227", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130328121227", "DocDate" : "26-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130327120934", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130327120934", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000020439_20130405130513", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020439_20130405130513", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 4", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000425962_20130117165638", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20130117165638", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation" }, { "Name" : "Urban Transport" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Urban Transport", "Percent" : 95 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "code" : "BV" }, { "name" : "Urban Transport", "code" : "TC" } ], "sectorcode" : "TC,BV", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Climate change", "Percent" : 5 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Climate change", "code" : "81" } ], "themecode" : "81", "totalamt" : 205000000, "totalcommamt" : 205000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P144489/ecuador-quito-metro-line-one?lang=en" }

This Disbursement-linked indicator (DLI) aimed to gradually increase the use of payment service providers (PSPs) that: (i) make payments electronically, and (ii) use two-factor authentication. The large distances covered by the program combined with severe capacity constraints within the government administration in Northern Kenya has meant that all key areas of the Hunger Safety Net Program (HSNP) implementation are subcontracted as follows: a) the administrative component, including targeting, enrollment, registration, and case management, is implemented by a consortium of Non-Governmental Organization (NGOs) headed by Oxfam GB; b) the payments component is managed by the Financial Sector Deepening Trust, which in turn sub-contracted Equity Bank to deliver payments to beneficiaries through a network of banking agents; c) the social protection rights component, which is designed to spread awareness of beneficiaries' rights, entitlements and responsibilities and to manage the complaint and grievance mechanism, is implemented by help age international; and d) the monitoring and evaluation component has been implemented by oxford policy management, which collects and analyzes data on a range of process and impact indicators." }, "project_name" : "National Safety Net Program for Results", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130704110647", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130704110647", "DocDate" : "26-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130613112339", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130613112339", "DocDate" : "11-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Other Social Protection Study (SPS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SPS", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130910122015", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130910122015", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Other Social Protection Study (SPS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "SPS", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130910123612", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130910123612", "DocDate" : "01-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120815093932", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120815093932", "DocDate" : "15-JUN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "code" : "BS" } ], "sectorcode" : "BS", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 90 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Natural disaster management", "code" : "52" }, { "name" : "Social risk mitigation", "code" : "87" } ], "themecode" : "87,52,54", "totalamt" : 250000000, "totalcommamt" : 250000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131305/national-integrated-safety-net-program?lang=en" }

The project has three components. The first component is maintaining access to essential healthcare services. This component aims to sustain the provision of essential healthcare services to the Jordanian population which is at risk due to the stress on resources resulting from the large influx of Syrian refugees. It has following two sub-components: (i) provision of vaccines and essential drugs to ensure adequate and continuous supply at all public healthcare facilities; and (ii) financing of healthcare services for Jordanians in non- Ministry of Health (MOH) health facilities. The second component is supporting household basic needs. The objective of this component is to help the Government of Jordan (GOJ) ensure the uninterrupted supply of basic household commodities for poor and lower middle class households. The two subsidized products financed under this component are bread (wheat) and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) cylinders. The third component is project monitoring, auditing, and verification.

The second pillar consists of public finance management reforms that support improved management and transparency around the use of public funds at a time of increased expenditure necessitated by the disaster response and heightened fiscal pressures.

The project has three components. The first component is strengthening the institutional, legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. This component aims to: (a) prepare an action plan to assess and reinforce the capacity of the National Federation of Microcredit Associations of Morocco (FNAM); and (b) support activities contributing to the strengthening of the legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework of the microfinance sector. This component will also finance goods, services, travel, and incremental operating costs incurred by the Project Management Unit (PMU) in the implementation and management of the project. It has following two sub-components: (a) prepare an action plan, including a comprehensive assessment to reinforce the capacity of the FNAM; and (b) carrying out studies to inform the development of a modern legal, regulatory, tax and governance framework for microfinance. The second component is strengthening the market infrastructure, product innovation and funding sources for microfinance. This component focuses on activities aimed at: (a) building common platforms improving the efficiency and effectiveness of microcredit associations; (b) building market infrastructure in support of microenterprises; and (c) promoting the strengthening and diversification of funding. It has following three sub-components: (i) promoting innovative common platforms and new products for Microfinance Institutions (MFIs); (ii) building market infrastructure for micro entrepreneurs; and (iii) strengthening and diversifying funding sources. The third component is integrating microfinance into a national financial inclusion strategy.

This component includes a 3x650-MW supercritical steam technology power plant, fired by natural gas as the primary fuel and by Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) as a backup. The plant comprises three identical units, each of 650 MW gross capacities. The plant will be cooled by a once-through cooling system using water from the Nile River. Each of the three units will include the standard set of equipment: a 650-MW steam generator, a steam turbine, a condenser, and an electricity generator; process and cooling water supply systems; an air and flue gas system; a fuel supply system; and a number of auxiliary systems (condensate treatment, hydrogen generation, compressed air, fire protection, emergency diesel generator, start-up power system, medium and low voltage system, direct current power system for control and relays, and uninterruptible power system). Finally, the second component is the gas pipelines. This component includes two gas pipelines capable of supplying approximately 12.5 million cubic meters of gas per day. One pipeline, 36 inches in diameter and 93 kilometers (km) long, will connect the Helwan South power plant site, which is near the town of Atfeeh, to the existing gas pipeline network at the compressor station at Dahshour." }, "project_name" : "EG - Helwan South Power Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" :

This component will seek to develop basic features of a social protection system, as outlined in the SSDP 2011-2013, and build government capacity to implement the project, through two interrelated sub-components. This component will focus on providing support to Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GOSS) in the development of a social protection policy, as well as putting in place the necessary implementation and coordination capacity. It has following two sub-components: (a) support for a social protection system. This sub-component will support GOSS to put in place the building blocks of a Social Protection (SP) system through assistance with the drafting of a social protection policy and putting in place a set of basic operational tools; and (b) capacity building and project management. The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Cooperatives, and Rural Development (MoAFCRD) will serve as the lead project implementing agency and will be responsible for the overall management and coordination of the project. The second component is public works. The objective of this component is to provide income for youth and women from poor households through a seasonal transfer, linked to participation in public works, in order to increase and sustain household assets, and smooth consumption during lean seasons. The third component is skills development. The objective of this component is to provide youth from poor and vulnerable households with access to livelihood opportunities through comprehensive skills development training comprised of technical, entrepreneurship and life skills.

The objective of this component is to reduce the vulnerability of coastal communities through infrastructure such as permanent houses, evacuation shelters and routes, and resilient electrical networks. It has following three sub-components: (i) resilient housing; (ii) evacuation shelters, routes and early warning systems; and (iii) cyclone resilient electrical network. The second component is sustainable fisheries. The objective of this component is to address gaps in the context of a long term vision for the fisheries sector. The component aims at upgrading infrastructure, developing an approach for co-management of fisheries and addressing safety at sea. This component has following two sub-components: (a) fishing infrastructure; and (b) Second Fisheries Management for Sustainable Livelihood (FIMSUL II). The third component is capacity building in disaster risk management. This component will focus on strengthening the capacity of government institutions, civil society, the school education system and coastal communities through following four sub-components: (i) strengthening of state disaster management authority; (ii) Community Based Disaster Risk Management Program (CBDRM); (iii) curriculum development on disaster risk reduction for schools and training institutions; and (iv) completing preparation of the Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) plan for Tamil Nadu, completing erection of High Tide Line (HTL) pillars across all 13 coastal districts and stake holder training on coastal zone management. The fourth component is implementation support. This will include incremental operating costs, that of operating the Project Management Unit (PMU) and respective Project Implementation Units (PIUs) in the line departments. In addition, the component will include consultancies required for the preparation and supervision of specific activities, trainings, exposure visits and knowledge exchange programs.

It will support the current sector institutions, as well as the preparation, implementation and full functioning of the new; legal and institutional framework resulting from alignments with the Constitution of Kenya 2010. It will also support integrated and participatory basin planning, including developing the requisite knowledge base and building capacity and institutional partnerships for effective water management and planning. The overall objective of this component will be to strengthen the enabling institutional and legal framework to sustainably advance Kenya's vast water sector investment program in order to achieve water security and climate resilience. It has following two sub-components: (i) support for water sector transition and reforms and (ii) strengthening water management and planning. The third component is support for project implementation. This component will support the establishment of the Project Management Unit (PMU) to provide for effective project implementation through the completion of the First Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience Project (KWSCRP-1) and throughout the reform period. This component will finance the required office space, goods (e.g., vehicles), equipment (e.g., computers), staff, consultant services, travel, training and operating costs that will allow the PMU to carry out its responsibilities for project implementation." }, "project_name" : "Kenya Water Security and Climate Resilience Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Procurement Plan (PROP),

While the credit will primarily translate into financing programs from the emergency priority action plan 2013-14, particular attention is given to the policy actions aimed at: (i) strengthening controls on budget and transparency, (ii) protecting pro-poor expenditures, (iii) restoring financial sustainability and investment capacity in power and irrigation sectors, and (iv) improving public financial and investment management. The operation fully shares the objectives of the World Bank Group's interim strategy note for FY14-15, and is aligned with the World Bank's Strategy for Africa. The operation is also part of a larger regional response to the crisis in the Sahel. While Mali is at the epicenter of the crisis, it is broadly understood that some of its causes, and the responses, have to be found at the regional Sahelian level.

Proactive integrated urban development strategies are urgently needed to address social exclusion, and create effective and long-term sustainable governance to benefit all residents. The value added of this operation lies in the potential knowledge partnership with the municipality.

This component aims at improving the accountability chain of the results chain for improving the quality of learning in the early grades of primary education at four levels. The first will be to provide performance financing education grants to District Education Authorities (IEF) under performance-based contracts (PBCs) between Regional Education Authorities and IEFs to improve the management of the education district and the quality and quantity of services they provide to schools in terms of supervision, support and advice, and teacher training. The second component is the strengthening equity in access to education. This component aims at reaching out-of-school children and providing them with a better quality education. This will be done by providing additional assistance to less advantaged areas in terms of new primary schools and by ensuring that all children notably in selected Daaras receive a quality basic education based on a well-defined curriculum.

The project has four components. The first component is agriculture value chains development in Bas-Congo. This component will increase the agricultural supply capabilities of farmers organizations and provide basic rural infrastructure in order to strengthen the targeted value chains and better supply markets, including Kinshasa. This component will finance consultant services to provide technical assistance (TA) and support services to farmers organizations and benefiting institutions; works (the construction of technical and collection platforms, rural roads and upgrading of electricity network); and goods and equipment. This component has following two sub-components: (i) enhancing agricultural supply capabilities; and (ii) support to rural infrastructures. The second component is special economic zone of Maluku. The development of the Maluku Special Economic Zone (SEZ) will provide access to much needed industrial land equipped with critical infrastructure and a more friendly business environment for investors and private sector operators, all of which have been identified as binding constraints in the 2006 investment climate assessment. This component has following three sub-components: (a) facilitation of Public-Private Partnership (PPP); (b) strengthening the capacity of relevant ministries in SEZ development; and (c) physical infrastructure. The third component is proactive business development. This component will improve the business environment with a view to promoting investments and support productive activities in the targeted value chains and poles. It aims at supporting and operationalizing the government approach to Strategic Partnerships Along Value Chains (SPAVC) that was presented to and well received by development partners at the end of 2012 in Kinshasa. It has following three sub-components: (1) project development fund for investment promotion; (2) targeted regulatory reforms; and (3) trade facilitation at the port of Matadi in the Bas-Congo. The fourth component is coordination, monitoring, communication and impact.

The AF will include a restructuring to introduce the following changes: (i) adjusting some results indicators and targets; (ii) splitting the SNCC workforce downsizing sub-category into two; (iii) amending several covenants in the original grant agreement to reflect changes in the political and economic situation as well as the actual time necessary to fulfill these covenants; and (iv) extending the project's closing date by 24 months to December 30, 2017, to complete the activities and fully achieve the development objectives." }, "project_name" : "DRC-Multi-Modal Transp Additional Financing", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130704110254", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130704110254", "DocDate" : "11-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130523101951", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130523101951", "DocDate" : "15-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120320101644", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120320101644", "DocDate" : "19-MAR-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120309094137", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120309094137", "DocDate" : "15-FEB-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Indigenous Peoples Plan (IP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "IP", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120322161354", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120322161354", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2008" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 2", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120322134611", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120322134611", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2008" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 2", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120322114330", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120322114330", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2008" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120322154946", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120322154946", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2008" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Railways" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation" }, { "Name" : "Ports, waterways and shipping" }, { "Name" : "Aviation" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Railways", "Percent" : 75 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Ports, waterways and shipping", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Aviation", "Percent" : 5 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Railways", "code" : "TW" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "code" : "BV" }, { "name" : "Ports, waterways and shipping", "code" : "TP" }, { "name" : "Aviation", "code" : "TV" } ], "sectorcode" : "TV,TP,BV,TW", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "Y", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Export development and competitiveness", "Percent" : 28 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Export development and competitiveness", "code" : "45" }, { "name" : "Infrastructure services for private sector development", "code" : "39" }, { "name" : "State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization", "code" : "43" }, { "name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "code" : "25" } ], "themecode" : "25,43,39,45", "totalamt" : 180000000, "totalcommamt" : 180000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P129594/drc-multi-modal-transp-additional-financing?lang=en" }

This third sub-component will support Small and Micro Enterprise Promotion Service (SMEPS) project management for this pilot. It will finance goods, services, travel (including international travel), and incremental operating costs incurred by SMEPS in the implementation and management of the project. The second component involves bank-executed activities, such as impact evaluation, technical assistance, and support. The second component will include the implementation of an impact evaluation and provision of technical assistance to the Government of Yemen to inform policies and programs on SME development and employment based on the outcomes and demonstrated effect of the pilot. The component will finance the costs of the impact evaluation and technical assistance provided to government entities and SMEPS, particularly on monitoring and evaluation." }, "project_name" : "SME Revitalization and Employment Pilot Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PROP", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130905110922", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130905110922", "DocDate" : "26-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000456286_20131111142427", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000456286_20131111142427", "DocDate" : "04-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130902103703", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130902103703", "DocDate" : "04-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130301120153", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130301120153", "DocDate" : "07-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000350881_20130327151819", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130327151819", "DocDate" : "20-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130109125649", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130109125649", "DocDate" : "20-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130109131639", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130109131639", "DocDate" : "20-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000350881_20130327154418", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130327154418", "DocDate" : "08-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000350881_20130328150117", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130328150117", "DocDate" : "08-NOV-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "OTHER", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Middle East and North Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "YZ", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support", "Percent" : 100 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise support", "code" : "41" } ], "themecode" : "41", "totalamt" : 0, "totalcommamt" : 3000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143715/sme-revitalization-employment-pilot-project?lang=en" }

The project has four components. The first component is provision of environmental sanitation and water supply services to priority low income areas of the GAMA. The objective of this component is to increase the access to environmental sanitation and water supply services in low income areas of the GAMA with a strong focus on liquid sanitation. This component also includes the development and implementation of a hygiene and sanitation behavior change campaign targeted at low-income households, and a major learning and dissemination effort aimed at informing a large-scale institutionalized approach to upgrading sanitation in low-income communities. The second component is improvement and expansion of the water distribution network in the GAMA. The objective of this component is to improve and expand the water distribution network in order to provide piped water to the targeted people living in low income communities in the GAMA. This component will also support the acquisition and installation of water meters and other equipment, as well as the provision of services, aimed at improving water demand management and reducing nonrevenue water. The third component is planning, improvement and expansion of GAMA-wide environmental sanitation services. The objective of this component is to develop integrated GAMA-wide plans for liquid and solid waste management and drainage, and to finance critical elements to improve collection, treatment and disposal of wastewater and septic sludge. Under this component the project will work closely with the International Finance Corporation (IFC) to engage the private sector to strengthen sustainability of treatment facilities and expand services in target areas through business development support.

(2) Rehabilitation of tributaries and drainage canals component will restore the natural storm drainage function of nearly 27 km of tributaries and canals feeding into the Cihu River by rehabilitating embankments, dredging and removing blockages.

This project has three components: The first component is strengthening the institutional capacity to improve the quality of selected health interventions at Performance-based Financing (PBF) health facilities. This component aims to support improvements to the quality of care related to maternal health, child health, and infectious disease interventions at selected hospitals in Liberia through the provision of performance-based incentives to support: (a) improved clinical practice; (b) adherence to well-established and defined clinical and treatment protocols; (c) health worker motivation (both intrinsic and extrinsic); (d) structural improvements (e.g. availability of drugs and commodities, and health facility rehabilitation); and, (e) improved management capacity, governance, monitoring and record keeping at health facilities. It has following two sub-components: (1) performance-based financing to address the systemic bottlenecks related to poor quality of care, and health system deficiencies; and (2) management and capacity building to provide intensive technical support to build the institutional capacity required to manage the PBF approach. The second component is improving health worker competencies to address key health-related concerns at selected health facilities. This component will complement efforts to improve the quality of care at target health facilities (discussed under first component), by improving the availability and competencies of health workers in these facilities, in critical specialist areas- obstetrics, pediatrics, general surgery and internal medicine. It has following two sub-components: (i) Graduate Medical Residency Program (GMRP) to support the design and implementation of a nationally accredited GMRP in defined critical specialist areas (obstetrics, surgery, pediatrics, and internal medicine, with a cross-cutting focus on anesthesiology); and (ii) in-service training programs to mid- level health cadres.

In addition, the transmission line along the corridor will have the capacity to connect around other 6,000 new consumers if additional financing becomes available. (2) Construction of facilities for off-loading, transport, and storage of heavy fuel oil (HFO) and support for optimization of HFO procurement component will support the government's decision to replace current expensive diesel-based generation with less costly HFO-based thermal generation. There are both physical and commercial aspects to optimizing the supply of fuel. Firstly, more reliable HFO supply will require physical investments in HFO off-loading, transport and storage facilities. Secondly, it requires improving HFO procurement practices.

This social movement started with calls for political change, a curbing of corruption and a more inclusive development process. In March 2011, the King of Morocco proposed a broad and comprehensive package of political reforms that were approved in a constitutional referendum held on July 1, 2011. The new constitution sets the basis for a more open and democratic society, provides mechanisms for the construction of a modern state of law and institutions, and lays the foundation for extended regionalization. These changes have followed on the heels of other reforms already undertaken since the current King came to power. Successive national governments have overseen an impressive political, economic and social transformation, with a marked acceleration of structural reforms in recent years. Sound macroeconomic management has produced solid foundations, and the country was on a recovery path from the stagnation of the 1990s when a series of adverse external shocks hit the economy, starting with the 2008 financial crisis. However, as shown, none of these factors provided total immunity to the rising tide of dissatisfaction and to the pressure from the outstanding development issues and challenges.

The short-term objective of this component will be to provide immediate employment for youth with no or little education through Labor Intensive Public Works (LIPW). It will promote the participation of women by selecting activities that are supportive of women employment and reserving a percentage of the LIPW jobs specifically for women. This component will also (with third component) support the mainstreaming of LIPWs into national policies, strategies and procedures and the establishment of a permanent capacity for LIPWs in the country. The second component is skills development. This component aims to improve youth employability by offering youth with different skills levels within their first training experience. This component has following three sub-components: (1) development of initial vocational training through a dual training approach for economic sectors (sub-component 2-1 A) and establishment of a demand driven training system and provision of training (sub-component 2-1 B); (2) apprenticeship program; and (3) entrepreneurship training and provision of follow up support to entrepreneurs. The third component is institutional capacity strengthening and project management. The purpose of this component is to: (a) strengthen the capacity of private and public sector institutions to engage in an informed policy dialogue on skills and employment on a regular basis, e.g. through technical capacity strengthening and the creation of a mechanism for consultations and collaboration; and (b) improve the knowledge base on employment and youth." }, "project_name" : "BF-Youth Employment & Skills Development", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b081d5f035_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d5f035_1_0", "DocDate" : "24-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130507101046", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130507101046", "DocDate" : "29-APR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130411135622", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130411135622", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Resettlement Plan (RPL),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "RPL", "EntityID" : "000231615_20130411142726", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000231615_20130411142726", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b081985160_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081985160_1_0", "DocDate" : "15-JAN-2013" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Vocational training" }, { "Name" : "Adult literacy/non-formal education" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 50 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Vocational training", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Adult literacy/non-formal education", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Vocational training", "code" : "EV" }, { "name" : "Adult literacy/non-formal education", "code" : "EL" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Other social services", "code" : "BS" } ], "sectorcode" : "BS,EL,EV,JB", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Improving labor markets", "Percent" : 75 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Improving labor markets", "code" : "51" }, { "name" : "Education for the knowledge economy", "code" : "66" } ], "themecode" : "66,51", "totalamt" : 50000000, "totalcommamt" : 50000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P130735/bf-youth-employment-skills-development?lang=en" }

The aim will be to develop new financial products, loan standards, risk management tools, and financial literacy and consumer protection capacity. In addition, pilots will be designed, launched and monitored. Building upon and complementing National Housing Bank (NHBs) monitoring and evaluation (M&E) systems and processes, this component will also support an impact assessment to independently assess the social and household level impact of the project. The second component is financial support for sustainable and affordable housing. This component will finance NHB to refinance, directly or indirectly through qualified intermediary institutions, low-income housing loans made by QPLIs to primary borrowers to purchase, build or upgrade their dwelling. NHB has recently prepared a refinancing scheme for secured low-income housing loans to borrowers with formal and informal incomes. NHB will develop guidelines (to be formulated and reflected in the projects operations manual) for the provision of alternatively secured housing loans to formal and informal borrowers. The third component is project implementation. A Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will be set up within NHB to help implement the project, carry out monitoring and evaluation, be responsible for legal issues and grievance redressal, overseeing and monitoring the social and environmental due diligence (including conducting annual third party audits of QPLIs), keeping the projects operations manual updated, and financial management and carry out any procurement necessary under the project. Low-income housing expertise will also be added to the PIU to provide technical inputs to the procurement of consultants services under component one.

It targets key medium term challenges to improving the quality of service delivery to Rwandan citizens. In recognition of the limited citizen participation and ownership of the development process, the Government has identified the decentralization process as the key focus for its accountable governance reforms. The Bank proposes this operation under challenging circumstances and a fluid aid environment. The financing provided through this operation will help the Government maintain public expenditures and service delivery in priority areas that are relevant for poverty reduction.

The project has four components. The first component is improvement and asset management of the East-West highway. It has following five sub-components: (i) upgrading of existing East-West highway through the construction of a 2-lane dual carriageway from Agara to Zemo Osiauri; (ii) maintenance of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway between Natakhtari and Ruisi; (iii) civil works to improve road safety and access roads on the existing East-West highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km) and along the existing E60 alignment between Ruisi and Chumateleti (44km); (iv) environmental improvement measures along completed sections of the E60 highway between Natakhtari and Ruisi (67km); and (v) construction supervision and quality assurance services. The second component is institutional strengthening. This component provides for the financing of activities to further deepen institutional strengthening efforts being carried out under ongoing bank supported projects. The activities are as follows: (a) institutional strengthening of the MRDI to help the following activities: review and updating of road sector strategy, support to the MRDI to improve road safety management capacity, support to the MRDI to improve the operating environment for the local construction industry, and measures to improve manpower planning and development in MRDI; (b) institutional strengthening of the RD to help organizational efficiency improvement and manpower planning and development measures, and development of a strategic roadmap for the development and implementation of Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS) along the East West highway corridor, from Tbilisi to Turkish border. The third component is preparation of designs and supporting studies for future projects for the development of the East-West highway. This component will finance activities for the definition and design of civil works included in component A of the proposed project and preparatory studies for the future westward upgrading of the E60. The planned activities include: (1) study to define the scope of the maintenance interventions along some upgraded sections of the E60 2-lane dual carriageway e.g. Natakhtari to Ruisi (67 kilometers); (2) road safety improvement studies and designs; (3) update of feasibility studies and undertaking of preliminary engineering design of new Rikoti tunnel and 60km of highway between Chumateleti and Argveta; and (4) detailed design of the new tunnel at Rikoti, preparation of bidding documents and independent review of all technical and safety provisions.

The project has three components. The first component is increasing access and equity at the primary level through rehabilitation and re-construction of classrooms. The objectives of this component are to: (i) rehabilitate or replace classrooms in disrepair and those built with non-durable materials (mud and straws and leaves); (ii) add or rehabilitate school director offices and annexed facilities such as latrines and water supply; and (iii) involve local communities, specifically the Conseils de gestion scolaire (COGES) in the provision and management of school infrastructures and furniture. The second component is improving the quality of the learning environment. This will support the teacher skills development in Equator and Kasai-West, and the provision of textbooks and pedagogical materials country-wide. This component has following two sub-components: (a) strengthening in-service training to improve teacher quality given the erosion of teacher training capacity through the crisis period; and (b) provision of learning materials, as planned in the Interim Education Plan (IEP), support the acquisition and the distribution of textbooks, country-wide to all public and private primary education schools. The third component is strengthening sector management. This component will support interventions to ensure that current regulations are applied and strengthened as a basis for more efficient and more accountable sector management. It has following three sub-components: (i) restructuring of the education administrative offices. This sub-component will consist of: (a) provision of operating costs for school management offices (Bureaux Gestionnaires de Proximite); (b) the development of management and reporting tools and communication activities; (c) the design of results-based agreements; and (d) financial audits and quality assessments; (ii) other strengthening of institutional capacity to provide technical assistance to Service de Controle et de la Paie des Enseignants (SECOPE) to implement reform. This technical assistance will cover the 3-year period of the project but will intervene on a periodic basis following a clear work plan; and (iii) project management and coordination.

Some of the lessons learned includes: (i) a strong institutional framework for social protection policy is necessary for setting-up a safety net system; (ii) sustainable strategies to support chronically food-insecure households require among others, regular cash transfers for periods of at least between 24 to 36 months; (iii) rigorous Management Information System (MIS) can inform strategic decision-making; and (iv) good targeting is necessary to provide support to those who are most in need." }, "project_name" : "Emergency Safety Nets project (Jigis&#233;m&#233;jiri)", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130506142917", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130506142917", "DocDate" : "30-APR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130321143429", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130321143429", "DocDate" : "19-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130327100415", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130327100415", "DocDate" : "18-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121203163558", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121203163558", "DocDate" : "19-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol.", "DocType" : "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012010614082991", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012010614082991", "DocDate" : "06-JAN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2011122212432675", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122212432675", "DocDate" : "22-DEC-2011" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other social services" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" } ], "sectorcode" : "JB", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 75 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Other human development", "code" : "70" }, { "name" : "Nutrition and food security", "code" : "68" }, { "name" : "Vulnerability assessment and monitoring", "code" : "55" } ], "themecode" : "55,68,70,54", "totalamt" : 70000000, "totalcommamt" : 70000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127328/mali-social-protection-employment-project-spep?lang=en" }

This component will support the development of a modern organization and management structure, instill a strategic focus, emphasize the importance of integrity, rationalize the organization structure to increase National Agency for Fiscal Administration (NAFA's) effectiveness, and strengthen human resource management through targeted professional training and technical assistance. The second component of the project is increasing operational effectiveness and efficiency. This component would streamline business processes and work-flows, and invest in the modernization of core information Technology (IT) systems to take full advantage of the possibilities offered by automation in NAFA's back office operations, as well as in the interaction with taxpayers and contributors. The third component of the project is taxpayer services and corporate communication. This component will finance activities aimed at modernizing taxpayer services; implementing mechanisms for transparency and accountability. The fourth component of the project is coordination and management.

The sub-components will dovetail the almost complete support provided by the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) to renovate, refurbish and equip health centers, including reinstating adequate provisions for waiting shelters for expecting mothers. Building on infrastructure improvement supported by MCA, the project will contribute to the supply-side improvements which are fundamental to strengthen the quality and utilization of health services. (2) Training of health professionals and Village Health Workers (VHWs) and improving monitoring and evaluation (M&E) capacity component will be solely financed through IDA financing and have two subcomponents. (2A) Training health professionals and VHWs will support an ongoing MOH program for training doctors, nurse anesthetists and midwives to achieve an acceptable standard of competency in the delivery of MNH.

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional loan in an amount of US$20.00 million to the project. The additional loan will help finance the costs associated with scaling up activities of a well-performing project in order to enhance the impact. This project paper also seeks the approval of a restructuring consisting in minor changes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) and related changes to the results framework. There are no new safeguard or fiduciary issues applicable to the additional financing (AF), which will use the same environmental and social management framework as the original project, updated in 2011. In terms of outcomes, the AF will support the preparation and implementation of more than 1,000 additional plans benefiting 31,600 additional families, compared to about 1,500 plans and 53,600 families under the original project, bringing the cumulative totals to about 2,500 plans and more than 85,000 beneficiary families.

The project aims to construct 2000 classrooms to alleviate the rising student-to-classroom ratio in the medium and long term, as enrollments continue to rise. The projects also aims to increase access and improve the quality of education through the school grants program in selected areas, which together with the provision of textbooks, will reduce the cost of schooling for households and improve the learning environment.

The project has three components. Component 1 is Performance-based Financing (PBF) scheme to improve MCH and NCD services in primary care facilities (US$4.3 million, of which US$1.8 million from the Health Results Innovation Trust Fund (HRITF) Grant). This component will support the strengthening of the on-going primary health care Performance-based Financing (PBF) program in Armenia as well as expanding its scope. It comprises two sub-components as follows: (1) performance-based payments for MCH and NCD (US$ 3.5million); and (2) performance-based financing implementation and capacity building (US$ 0.8 million). The second component is improving efficiency and quality of selected hospitals (US$38.9 million). This component aims at improving further efficiency and quality of hospital services provision in Armenia by supporting hospital optimization in the only remaining region and improving infrastructure and treatment capacity at selected specialized tertiary level mono-profile hospitals. It comprises four subcomponents as follows: (1) modernization of Lori Marz hospital network (US$13.0 million); (2) modernization of Center of Hematology named after Professor Yeolyan CJSC (US$13.0 million); (3) modernization of cancer treatment services in Armenia (US$12.4 million); and (4) hospital quality improvement (US$0.5million).

The operation supports four areas that are central to the Government's reform program: (1) tax reform will support the Government's tax policy and administration reforms and its improvements in international tax information sharing. Together, these reforms are expected to mobilize tax revenue and facilitate the international exchange of tax information; (2) modernizing public procurement practices will significantly increase accountability and transparency and reduce transaction costs, since 37 percent of non-financial sector public spending is done through procurement; (3) increasing the efficiency of debt management; a major challenge for debt management in Panama is the lack of a medium-term debt management strategy. In particular, while overall guidelines such as the development of the domestic debt market and the smoothing of the debt profile exist, there is no formal debt management strategy in place. Such a strategy will establish target ranges for selected indicators of financial risk after assessing the cost-risk tradeoffs of different alternatives; and (4) and expanding and improving targeting of social transfer programs." }, "project_name" : "Second Programmatic Development Policy Loan", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081cf60ca_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081cf60ca_1_0", "DocDate" : "08-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000350881_20130305095443", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20130305095443", "DocDate" : "15-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130625111342", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130625111342", "DocDate" : "15-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130214092900", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130214092900", "DocDate" : "11-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000425962_20130305134429", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000425962_20130305134429", "DocDate" : "11-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130205123330", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130205123330", "DocDate" : "05-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121203163632", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121203163632", "DocDate" : "05-NOV-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Primary education" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 50 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 17 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 17 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Primary education", "Percent" : 16 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Primary education", "code" : "EP" } ], "sectorcode" : "EP,JB,BZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Debt management and fiscal sustainability", "Percent" : 17 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Debt management and fiscal sustainability", "code" : "21" }, { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Social risk mitigation", "code" : "87" }, { "name" : "Tax policy and administration", "code" : "28" } ], "themecode" : "28,87,27,54,21", "totalamt" : 100000000, "totalcommamt" : 100000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P127332/second-programmatic-development-policy-loan?lang=en" }

This component has following two sub-components: (1) help the Borrower to develop systems to coordinate and manage safety nets programs for the poor and vulnerable; and (2) finance the cost of the management, coordination, and monitoring and evaluation (M and E) activities under this and the other two project components. The second component is the pilot cash transfer program with accompanying measures to boost household productivity (US$36.3 million). This component is for supporting the development and to boost the productivity of chronically poor households and serve as the cornerstone of Cameroons social safety net. Accompanying measures are to be developed to maximize the impact of the cash transfers on the welfare and productivity of beneficiary households.

Overall long-term growth projections remain positive but dependent on commodity shocks and on public investment efficiency, while inclusive growth will depend on the economy's ability for structural transformation.

The project has following two components: (1) sunshine schools program support - installation of 100 megawatt (MW) rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems in Beijing. This component will install 100 MW of distributed rooftop PV systems in about 800 schools and other educational institutions in Beijing under the Renewable Energy Service Company (RESCO) model for large-scale rooftop solar PV deployment. Similar to the Energy Service Company (ESCO) business model adopted by the central government as a key market mechanism to scale up energy efficiency investments, the RESCO will take the performance and financial risk of the investment by signing an energy service performance contract (ESPC) with each school and university, which will pay the RESCO only for the solar PV electricity it consumes. The Bank loan will be on-lent to the RESCO by the Beijing municipality; and (2) technical assistance (TA) for developing local capacity for scaling up solar energy deployment, project implementation, and other priority energy policy initiatives of the Beijing Municipal Government (BMG). TA activities include: (i) demonstration of the RESCO model for large-scale grid-connected rooftop solar PV deployment in Beijing municipality, provision of engineering and technical support in relation to PV systems to Yuanshen Company, and independent monitoring and evaluation of implementation and results of such model; (ii) demonstration of two-way metering in Beijing municipality; (iii) establishment of an online monitoring system for rooftop PV systems and a solar energy information portal in Beijing municipality; and (iv) improvement of renewable energy education in schools and other educational institutions in Beijing municipality." }, "project_name" : "CN: Beijing Rooftop Solar Photovoltaic Scale-Up (Sunshine Schools) Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b082036295_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036295_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Agreement (PRA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PRA", "EntityID" : "090224b082036253_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036253_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "LA", "EntityID" : "090224b082036200_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082036200_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081c912cf_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c912cf_1_0", "DocDate" : "20-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130304105822", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130304105822", "DocDate" : "07-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0818582da_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818582da_1_0", "DocDate" : "26-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b0818430f6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818430f6_1_0", "DocDate" : "26-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "090224b0817df23b_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817df23b_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "090224b0817eee9c_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817eee9c_1_0", "DocDate" : "05-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029014326", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029014326", "DocDate" : "01-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029013954", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029013954", "DocDate" : "01-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2011122915320679", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122915320679", "DocDate" : "29-DEC-2011" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2011122914303915", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2011122914303915", "DocDate" : "29-DEC-2011" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other Renewable Energy" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other Renewable Energy", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other Renewable Energy", "code" : "LR" } ], "sectorcode" : "LR", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Other urban development", "Percent" : 33 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other urban development", "code" : "74" }, { "name" : "Climate change", "code" : "81" } ], "themecode" : "81,74", "totalamt" : 120000000, "totalcommamt" : 120000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P125022/cn-beijing-energy-efficiency-emission-reduction-demo?lang=en" }

The operation will also look at two cross-cutting themes: (a) protecting the poor from adverse effects of Vietnam's economic transition and competitiveness-related reforms; and (b) promoting greater data and policymaking transparency. Analytical work and policy dialogue will aim to ensure that these cross-cutting issues are appropriately taken into account in the reforms supported under the operation. The design of the EMCC is based on feedback from the government and development partners, and lessons learnt from implementation of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series." }, "project_name" : "Economic Management Competitiveness Credit 1", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081dd98e6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081dd98e6_1_0", "DocDate" : "11-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081c9062c_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c9062c_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130325095848", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130325095848", "DocDate" : "19-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130402100947", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130402100947", "DocDate" : "19-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20121227102846", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20121227102846", "DocDate" : "21-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121114132954", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121114132954", "DocDate" : "25-OCT-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "Banking" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "Central government administration" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 34 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Banking", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 22 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "Banking", "code" : "FA" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" } ], "sectorcode" : "BC,YZ,FA,BZ", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization", "Percent" : 22 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "State-owned enterprise restructuring and privatization", "code" : "43" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Other accountability/anti-corruption", "code" : "29" }, { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Macroeconomic management", "code" : "23" } ], "themecode" : "23,40,29,27,43", "totalamt" : 250000000, "totalcommamt" : 250000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122793/economic-management-competitiveness-credit-1?lang=en" }

The credit will help finance the costs associated with alleviating the emergency in the country's agriculture sector caused by the 2012 drought. The drought caused extensive losses to the country's field crops, i.e. wheat, sunflower, and particularly corn (for example 60 percent losses in corn production), leading to a shortage of animal feed. Without immediate support to affected farmers the livestock sub-sector will be under significant risk for destocking and loss of capital, with potential long-term negative consequences. The project will help to reduce the risk of destocking by providing conditional cash transfers and technical assistance (awareness and training) to farmers in the most affected districts, so as to maintain their ability to plant spring crops, and particularly corn and wheat. Corn is an especially important crop because pastures are scarce in Moldova, and corn is the main animal feed, both in the form of grain and silage. Corn is also an important staple for Moldovans, as it used in the local diet for the traditional dish called mamaliga." }, "project_name" : "Emergency Agriculture Support Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081f19ed5_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081f19ed5_1_0", "DocDate" : "25-SEP-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081c3c554_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3c554_1_0", "DocDate" : "29-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b081c3c5be_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c3c5be_1_0", "DocDate" : "29-MAY-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000442464_20130319170123", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000442464_20130319170123", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130212112157", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130212112157", "DocDate" : "12-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20130212111009", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20130212111009", "DocDate" : "14-DEC-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Europe and Central Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Crops" }, { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry" }, { "Name" : "Animal production" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Crops", "Percent" : 46 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 46 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry", "Percent" : 7 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Animal production", "Percent" : 1 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Crops", "code" : "AH" }, { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Agriculture, fishing and forestry", "code" : "BL" }, { "name" : "Animal production", "code" : "AJ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AJ,BL,JB,AH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 48 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Other rural development", "code" : "79" } ], "themecode" : "79,54", "totalamt" : 10000000, "totalcommamt" : 10000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P143202/emergency-agriculture-support-project?lang=en" }

Looking forward, the challenge will be in the implementation and coordination of all the policies that affect private sector development, investment and job creation.

On-budget funding will support the implementation of key elements of the Government's ECE program (program 239, complemented by decision 60). The SRPP will reimburse Government investments under the following eligible expenditure programs: (a) lunch subsidies3 for disadvantaged children aged 3-54, which will encourage participation and full day preschool attendance; and (b) salaries, including social and health insurance contributions, for contract preschool teachers to ease the shortage of teaching staff. Finally, the second component is the national early childhood education policy development and capacity building.

The Additional Financing (AF) will support connecting an additional 48,000 households to the electricity grid as part of the second phase of the Electricity Access Rollout Program (EARP). In addition, the AF will support scaling up of 'green connections' associated with energy efficient solutions; increased uptake of solar products such as solar water heaters and solar photo-voltaic systems; low-cost products such as ready-boards to make it affordable for low-income households to get connected to the electricity grid; and productive uses of electricity to promote increased use of electricity by SMEs. The additional activities have been estimated to be implemented in a timeframe of about 3 1/2 years.

The works will include works to the road surface and pavement, drainage improvements, restoration of shoulders and road furniture such as guardrails, road signs and marking. The second component is the institutional support and capacity building. This component will finance activities to strengthen the RMF's and Ministry of Public Works and Highways, or MPWH's capacity for road asset management, including axle load controls through technological connectivity of the control stations with RMF's headquarters in Sana'a and installation of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) equipment and software for improved communication with the road users. Finally, the third component is the transport sector studies. This component will finance technical assistance to address deficiencies and inefficiencies in transport infrastructure provision, maintenance and operation, at the same time support preparation of investments with potentials for other donors' financial support. This will include feasibility and preliminary engineering and operations and maintenance studies to assess the potential of public, private and/or public private partnership investments in the transport sector in Yemen, including public transport and operation of Sana'a and Aden airports and of Al-Hodeidah seaport." }, "project_name" : "RY-Road Asset Management Project", "projectdocs" : [ {

There are four components to the project, the first component being institutional strengthening, and capacity building and implementation support of Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM). This component aims to develop and/or strengthen DHM's legal and regulatory frameworks, improve institutional performance as the main provider of weather, climate and hydrological information for the nation, build capacity of personnel and management, ensure operability of the future networks, and support project implementation. The second component is the modernization of the observation networks and forecasting. The third component is the enhancement of the service delivery system of DHM. The objective of this component is to enhance the service delivery system of DHM by creating a public weather service that provides weather and impact forecasts, and information services for climate-vulnerable communities and the key weather dependent sectors of economy.

This new series builds on the excellent sectoral dialogue with the Government, the overall success of the previous two operations and the need to consolidate medium-term reforms. It will be implemented in parallel with the second phase (2013-2017) of the Government's ongoing 15-year National Solid Waste Program (PNDM) and will support its transition to full implementation and roll-out, while focusing on the overall coherence of the sector with the new decentralization agenda. In this context, the programmatic series aims to support the Government's efforts to improve the economic, environmental and social performance of the MSW sector. The measures supported by this DPL focus on: 1) strengthening governance, particularly demand-side governance, in the sector by improving accountability, transparency, and access to information, and by providing citizens and civil society with new and effective opportunities for engagement and voice; 2) anchoring long-term institutional and financial sustainability of the sector in line with the new decentralization agenda; 3) upgrading the country's environmental monitoring and control system; and 4) developing a financially viable and socially inclusive waste recycling sector.

This component will implement measures to strengthen the climate resilience of the economically critical WCR, which is a key Government of Samoa (GoS) objective under the Strategic Program for Climate Resilience (SPCR). Works will improve the road pavement between Vailoa junction in Apia and Faleolo International Airport (approximately 26 km) by raising and strengthening vulnerable sections of the WCR, sealing shoulders, and improving longitudinal and cross drainage. The second component is the vulnerability assessment of the Samoa road network. This component involves technical assistance that will directly support the SPCR by bringing about transformative change in the way that climate change is addressed in the Samoa roads sector. Finally, the third component is the project management and operating costs. This component will also provide funding for specific inter-project SPCR coordination activities, such as: (a) knowledge exchange and lessons learned to feed into the coordination of the SPCR at a programmatic level; (b) resources for GoS officials to participate and contribute to overall SPCR processes; and (c) monitoring and evaluating project results." }, "project_name" : "Enhancing the

The project has two components. (1) Lifeline road improvement component will finance the improvement (rehabilitation and/or upgrading) of an estimated 170 km of lifeline roads. The first year program was identified during the project preparation. Around 72 km (seven road segments) will be improved (including a 23 km corridor where a pilot on rehabilitation and maintenance is going to be implemented). The remaining 98 km will be identified during the implementation. Detailed designs for those roads, as well as supervision of civil works are also included under this component.

There are three components to the project, the first component being promoting renewable energy technologies. This component will include the following activities: (i) support the dissemination of knowledge and information on renewable energy technologies (including, inter alia, bio-gas digesters, solar water heaters, and solar photovoltaic and biomass installations) by provision of goods, works and training for demonstration purposes in selected districts; and (ii) provision of support to beneficiaries for the carrying out of renewable energy subprojects. The second component is the promoting technologies and practices to mitigate irrigated land degradation. Activities under this component will aim at introducing technologies and management approaches for controlling and reversing irrigated land degradation. This includes the introduction, testing and demonstration of integrated low-cost, low-risk water and land management technologies, such as drip irrigation, salinity mitigation of marginal land, water re-use, soil quality enhancement, pumping for groundwater extraction, alternative cropping, and other techniques and practices to increase water use efficiency and agricultural productivity.

This program document states a Reengagement and Reform Support Credit (RRSC) to the Republic of the Union of Myanmar for SDR287.75 (US$440 million equivalent). It will be a standalone development policy operation (DPO) program aimed at supporting the full normalization of relations between Myanmar and the World Bank as well as the Government's efforts to undertake critical institutional and policy reforms in the implementation of its medium-term development strategy. In terms of IDA resources, Myanmar is eligible for exceptional support as a reengaging country. Since Myanmar is projected to be at a low risk of debt distress after arrears clearance, IDA resources will be provided on credit terms, per the stipulations of the credit allocation system agreed with IDA donors for the IDA 16 period (FY12-FY14). Going forward, the Government realizes that a key challenge will be to ensure that these reforms translate into improved living standards for the majority of the population, and that gains registered are sustained. The program document is divided into six sections, including this introduction. Second section discusses the country context which gives an overview of Myanmar focusing on the political and economic context, recent economic developments, macroeconomic outlook, and debt sustainability. Third section presents the Myanmar Government's development program; fourth section discusses how the Bank is supporting the government's program, while section fifth describes the DPO.

The second component is community-based activities for adaptation and sustainable land management. this component supports community-based activities in watershed and flood-prone areas: resilience to flooding will be strengthened through targeted pilot activities at the local level that will enable communities to better manage disaster risk and land degradation; community-based activities in cropland and grazing land; community-based sustainable forest and wetland management: communities will be assisted in preparing sustainable financing plans and in designing small income generation activities in and around select protected areas and forests to reduce pressure on forest resources and restore ecosystem services. The third component is early warning, monitoring, and knowledge systems. This component supports Early Warning System (EWS): A nation-wide EWS will be developed to alert communities of upcoming possible flood events and allow them to take appropriate actions to protect lives and property, through enhanced collaboration and communications between the national hydro meteorological services and the Togolese Red Cross; and environmental monitoring. The fourth component is project management.

The first component is advancing Nile basin-wide cooperation and analysis. This component will support results at Nile-SEC related to its two core functions of facilitating cooperation and water resources management. Under this component, the NBI will provide targeted technical assistance and operational support to the Nile governments and wider stakeholders, including tools, knowledge products, analysis and opportunity for dialogue. It has two sub-components as noted below: (a) strengthening the platform for basin-wide cooperation; and (b) enhancing capacity and understanding for cooperative management and development of water resources in the Nile basin. The second component is promotion of sustainable development and planning in the Nile equatorial lakes region. This component will support NELSAP-CU in its efforts to identify and prepare potential strategic cooperative investment opportunities.

This component aims to build the institutional capacity of the island councils and communities in the five islands to plan and implement an island level integrated SWM program to minimize the environmental risks to the country's marine and terrestrial assets while reducing GHG emissions. It has following four sub-components: (i) community participation in source segregation of solid waste to create community awareness on the environment and public health implications of poor SWM in the respective islands and solicit community participation for source segregation of household level solid waste; (ii) implementation of an island level recycling and composting program at the Island Waste Management Centers (IWMCs) to finance: (a) the construction of a concrete pad for composting with a drainage system for leachate collection at each of the IWMCs; and (b) training of staff to undertake simple windrow composting at the IWMCs; (iii) institutional capacity building of the island councils and communities for planning and managing an effective island level integrated SWM system; and (iv) development of a strategy to operationalize the European Union (EU)- financed IWMCs in the atolls of the central province. The second component is development of institutional arrangements and implementation of a waste transfer system for off-island disposal of residual solid waste. The objective of this component is to develop an effective, working institutional model to transfer residual waste from the participating islands of Ari Atoll to the Thilafushi island facility and demonstrate the use of this model for residual waste transfer for all central province atolls. The third component is project management.

The operation supports the recipient's efforts to improve economic governance by strengthening government accountability, public sector performance, and promoting growth through private sector development. Policies and reforms supported by this operation are well aligned with Senegal's National Strategy for Economic and Social Development (SNDES), which the Bank supports. The operation is also fully consistent with the objectives of the Bank's FY13-17 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), to be presented to the Board in January 2013. The operation is rooted in the World Bank's Africa strategy. The operation is aligned with the first pillar of the Africa strategy employment and growth and emphasizes the governance foundation of that strategy. By helping create fiscal space, it also aims to improve the government's capacity to cope with external shocks the second pillar of the strategy. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has slowed to levels not much above the rate of population growth and poverty remains high. The economy has shown little structural change, a continued dependence on remittances to fuel domestic demand, a growing reliance on capital-intensive exports while labor-intensive sectors faltered, and thus little job creation.

There are five components to the project. The first component is strengthening capacity for decentralized rural development. The first component of Phase 3 aims to enhance local governance and improve local development planning and management by local governments at all levels. It will build on achievements from earlier phases by deepening technical and capacity building for local stakeholders. Under the project, local governments will develop new communal development plans, prepare annual investment plans, and identify local development projects in strategic, holistic and multi-sectoral manner in collaboration with local communities, local communes, and deconcentrated technical services, the private sector and civil society. The second component is implementation of the rural land legislation and enhancement of local dispute resolution mechanisms. With the legal and regulatory framework for land tenure now in place from earlier phases, the component seeks to support the implementation of the land tenure policy and law. This will be pursued through: (i) the establishment and operation of rural land tenure services at commune level, village land tenure commissions, and village conciliation commissions; (ii) land titling operations; (iii) strengthening of capacity of local actors and rural communes to carry out land titling processes efficiently and transparently; and iv) dissemination of the law to increase men, women and illiterates' awareness about their rights, and pave the way for a more gender-balanced access to land. The third component is local and regional investments. Component three will support communes in promoting socio-economic growth and sustainable development through the financing of strategic local development investments, for all the 302 rural communes in the 13 regions. The fourth component is sustainable land and forestry management. This component aims to support restoration and protection of natural resources, forest and biodiversity in the larger ecosystem landscape related to agricultural expansion.

The First Development Policy Loan (DPL1) (US$45 million) will be the first of a two-part Social Inclusion DPL series that aims at supporting the social inclusion reform agenda of the Government of Peru (GoP). The first phase of the social inclusion reform program, supported by this DPL1, will focus on the establishment of the new Ministry of Development and Social Inclusion (MIDIS) to initiate the social policy reforms under its responsibility. The second phase of the reform, which will focus on the implementation and consolidation of these reforms, is expected to be supported by a second DPL (Social Inclusion DPL2), planned for FY14. The DPL1 is being presented to the Board together with the Social Inclusion Technical Assistance Loan (TAL). The TAL will support the development of the second phase of reforms and, as such, will provide a bridge of technical support between the two DPL operations. Peru has achieved consistent economic growth, declines in poverty and inequality, and improvements in social indicators over the past decade. However, the Government recognizes that many social and income disparities remain pervasive in the country. Despite the prevalence of social programs, they are fragmented and ineffective in providing a coherent and consistent package of support to the poor. The Government has, therefore, announced a Growth with Inclusion plan that mainly aims at: (i) providing equal access to basic services, employment, and social security; and (ii) reducing extreme poverty, with an emphasis on rural poverty. The Government has created MIDIS to spearhead a large part of this agenda with a focus on the reform of social policies and programs." }, "project_name" : "PE Social Inclusion DPL", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "LA", "EntityID" : "090224b081b8768e_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081b8768e_1_0", "DocDate" : "21-APR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081ab17fa_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081ab17fa_1_0", "DocDate" : "13-APR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333037_20121220014223", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20121220014223", "DocDate" : "13-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130418123725", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130418123725", "DocDate" : "13-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121218002546", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121218002546", "DocDate" : "13-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121107133637", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121107133637", "DocDate" : "21-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130418115955", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130418115955", "DocDate" : "21-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120703151928", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120703151928", "DocDate" : "30-MAY-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Other social services" }, { "Name" : "Health" }, { "Name" : "General education sector" }, { "Name" : "Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Other social services", "Percent" : 58 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Health", "Percent" : 21 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General education sector", "Percent" : 15 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance", "Percent" : 6 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Other social services", "code" : "JB" }, { "name" : "Health", "code" : "JA" }, { "name" : "General education sector", "code" : "EZ" }, { "name" : "Compulsory pension and unemployment insurance", "code" : "BE" } ], "sectorcode" : "BE,EZ,JA,JB", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Social safety nets", "Percent" : 50 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Social safety nets", "code" : "54" }, { "name" : "Nutrition and food security", "code" : "68" }, { "name" : "Vulnerability assessment and monitoring", "code" : "55" }, { "name" : "Social risk mitigation", "code" : "87" } ], "themecode" : "87,55,68,54", "totalamt" : 45000000, "totalcommamt" : 45000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P131028/pe-social-inclusion-dpl?lang=en" }

This component includes: provision of support to design and pilot activities aimed at improving the quality control of MIDIS's programs by: (i) developing user's participation and accountability mechanisms for the MIDIS's programs. First component contributes to the Project Development Objective (PDO) by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through accountability mechanisms that institutionalize channels for user's feedback; and the development of planning, information, monitoring and evaluation tools for MIDIS's decentralized offices that coordinate the provision of social programs in the territory. Second component is improving knowledge management, information and communication. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that improve the performance of MIDIS's programs and strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy through the implementation of an integrated information platform that includes data from different programs; the interconnectivity of local targeting units that are strengthened with trained staff on information management, monitoring and customer service; and the development of a national communication strategy that includes different approaches for different population groups. Third component is strengthening of MIDIS's capacity on results orientation, monitoring and evaluation. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's capacity to monitor social inclusion policy 27 through the development of information dashboards to oversee infant malnutrition and development plans; and technical assistance to improve the evaluation of programs processes, potential effects and impacts. Fourth component is strengthening of human resource management and capacity. This contributes to the PDO by supporting activities that strengthen MIDIS's systems and capacity to improve the performance of MIDIS's programs through the introduction of result-oriented human resources management practices. Fifth component is support to project administration.

There are three components to the project, the first component being trade facilitation, trade policy, and regulations. This component builds on the success of trade facilitation and trade policy activities under First Trade Development Facility (TDF-1), and will consist of a number of inter-related activities aimed at improving transparency, predictability and lowering associated compliance costs for traders. Trade facilitation activities will focus primarily on improving inter-agency coordination and supporting the adoption of modern risk based approaches to managing regulatory compliance in non-customs agencies, including reform of non-tariff measures. The second component is the diversification and competitiveness.  This component includes a new set of activities aiming to support improved private sector capacity to improve productivity and compete in international markets, focusing on the non natural resources sectors (in particular outside of mining and hydropower). Activities will facilitate the more effective participation of small and medium sized enterprises in the international economy, better skills and labor standards in the manufacturing sector and support to women's economic empowerment.

This program document states an Economic Reform Grant, a stand-alone development policy operation (DPO), to the Union of the Comoros. The single tranche DPO, in the amount of SDR 3.3 million (US$5 million equivalent), supports the implementation of core reforms in Comoros's Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy (PRGSP), at a time when the country is aiming at reaching the Completion Point under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC CP) by end 2012. A previous DPO, the Economic Governance Reform Support Grant (EGRSG), in an amount of US$3 million equivalent, was approved by the Board on June 1, 2010 and disbursed in October 2010. In the politically difficult context of the late 2010 elections, slower than expected implementation of reforms and slippage in macroeconomic performance resulted in delays in the preparation of the planned second DPO. Since mid-2011, the authorities have rekindled the reform process, taken steps to bring the budget under control, and shown a renewed commitment to advancing on structural and institutional reforms. The main goal of the operation is to support government-owned reforms in four out of the six axes spelled out in the country's PRGSP, namely (i) axis one, on economic stabilization and equitable growth, emphasizing improvements in fiscal policy and public financial management; (ii) axis two, on strengthening key sectors by focusing on institution-building and ensuring a broader role for the private sector, with this operation's focus on the electricity sector; (iii) axis three, on strengthening governance and social cohesion, focusing on improvements in core government personnel management systems and stepping up the fight against corruption and fostering transparency in the issuance of fishing licenses and agreements; and (iv) axis six, on promoting environmental sustainability and civilian security, emphasizing disaster risk management." }, "project_name" : "Comoros Development Policy Grant 2", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081da638a_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081da638a_1_0", "DocDate" : "03-AUG-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "090224b081d381c6_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d381c6_1_0", "DocDate" : "18-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0818de59a_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0818de59a_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121206001007", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121206001007", "DocDate" : "29-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121108005417", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121108005417", "DocDate" : "30-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121019154559", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121019154559", "DocDate" : "19-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120705131807", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120705131807", "DocDate" : "05-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "000171540_2012031314561303", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2012031314561303", "DocDate" : "31-JAN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "Irrigation and drainage" }, { "Name" : "Transmission and Distribution of Electricity" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 76 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Irrigation and drainage", "Percent" : 12 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Transmission and Distribution of Electricity", "Percent" : 12 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "Irrigation and drainage", "code" : "AI" }, { "name" : "Transmission and Distribution of Electricity", "code" : "LT" } ], "sectorcode" : "LT,AI,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Natural disaster management", "Percent" : 12 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Natural disaster management", "code" : "52" }, { "name" : "Other accountability/anti-corruption", "code" : "29" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Other public sector governance", "code" : "30" }, { "name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "code" : "25" } ], "themecode" : "25,30,27,29,52", "totalamt" : 5000000, "totalcommamt" : 5000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122941/comoros-development-policy-grant-2?lang=en" }

There are five components to the project. The first component of the project is investment in HCFC-141b consumption reduction in the PU foam sector. This component will make provision of support to foam system houses to modify their production process, in order to provide hydrocarbon pre-blended polyol to enterprises that cannot adopt full-scale hydrocarbon technology. The second component of the project is investment in HCFC production reduction. The funding under this component will be used to compensate HCFC producers for surrendering their production rights in part or in full in order to contribute to the national compliance with the production freeze and 10 percent production reduction in 2013 and 2015, respectively. The third component of the project is technical assistance and policy support. This component will make provision of support to activities related to identification and testing of potential substitutes for HCFCs. The fourth component of the project is project management. This component will make provision of technical assistance to improve the capacity of Foreign Economic Cooperation Office of the Ministry of Environmental Protection (FECO) and the Project Management Office (PMO) to manage, supervise, coordinate, monitor and evaluate the implementation of the project.

The third component is implementation support and technical assistance. This component will finance implementation support and technical assistance to: (a) strengthen the capacity of staff of the Project Management Unit (PMU), province-level government agencies, participating Kecamatans, participating Kotas, participating Kabupatens and participating Kelurahan in project implementation and monitoring, including through the National Management Consultants (NMC), Oversight Consultants (OC), city coordinators, and facilitators; and (b) carry out and support monitoring and evaluation. In addition, the component would continue to support monitoring and evaluation activities to ensure timely progress reports and annual evaluation reports for feedback to strengthen program implementation; activities could also support capacity building on Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) for the national government. The fourth component is contingency for disaster response. This component will finance preparedness and rapid response measures to address disaster, emergency and/or catastrophic events, as needed, at the Kelurahan level through Sub-projects and/or using the project implementation arrangements.

Initially focused on supporting the GoI's macroeconomic stabilization efforts, the previous DPL series covered a broad range of reform efforts aimed at improving the investment climate, strengthening public financial management and enhancing poverty alleviation and service delivery.

The objective of the operation is to promote the development of a sound, efficient and inclusive financial sector and support improvements in the investment climate in Indonesia to help the Government of Indonesia (GOI) achieve its medium-term economic development and poverty reduction goals. The Government has recently articulated its vision to turn Indonesia's economy into one of the world's ten largest by 2025. A sound and well functioning financial sector and an enabling environment for business are expected to contribute to the achievement of these goals. The main areas of policy and institutional reform supported under the loan will be: (i) reinforcing financial system stability; (ii) promoting financial sector diversification; (iii) enhancing financial inclusion; and (iv) supporting investment climate regulatory reform. The DPL is fully aligned with the Indonesia Country Partnership Strategy Progress (CPS) for the period of 2009-2012. Specifically, the report focuses on the core engagement areas of private sector development and social protection, as well as in its approach to support Indonesia's institutions. A new Indonesia CPS is currently under preparation and also includes a focus on private sector development. The FIRM DPL also includes an investment climate component that complements the ongoing financial sector reforms and reflects the Government's commitment to creating an economic environment conducive to private sector investment.

The operation is the second in a programmatic series of two development policy operations. The operation will be financed by International Development Association (IDA) resources of US$1.8 million and Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID) is expected to provide associated sector budget support of AUD 5.0 million (US$5.3 million) for the same policy actions and dependent on the Bank's operation being approved. The operation will help the Government of Tonga manage severe economic challenges that have coincided with historic political reforms. It supports a focused program of Government reform priorities in public financial management, fiscal policy, and business environment reforms while providing a vital fiscal buffer in the context of sustained revenue contraction. The series of operations coincide with the term in office of Tonga's first Government to be selected by a majority-elected parliament and provide an opportunity for the Bank to support Tonga at a critical juncture in its development process. The programmatic series of economic recovery operations focuses on three reform areas. Areas of focus reflect Government's concern to support short-term recovery and mitigate continuing impacts of the crisis on the poorest households while maintaining progress against longer-term structural reforms to deal with ongoing fiscal and economic challenges. Areas of focus include: i) strengthening public financial management; ii) strengthening fiscal policy; and iii) promoting structural reforms relating to the business regulatory environment. The first Tonga Economic recovery operation also supported reforms to strengthen social protection. The Second Tonga economic recovery operation will build on the gains achieved to date. In the area of public financial management, priorities reflect the importance of embedding transparency and solid Public Financial Management (PFM) foundations following recent political reforms. Actions in this area include introduction of a treasury single account, publication of in-year budget reports, and the tabling in Parliament of audited Annual Financial Statements of Government. Under fiscal policy, the agenda focuses on strengthening revenue effort to maintain delivery of public services following substantial revenue declines.

There are three components to the project. The first component is investment in HCFC-141b consumption phase-out. This component will support the cost of conversion to non-HCFC technology in the foam sector. It will consist of a series of investment activities (mainly procurement of equipment) at twelve foam producers. The project will promote the adoption of hydrocarbon technology in the foam sector, except in the manufacturing of integral skin shoe sole, where the water blown Carbon dioxide (CO2) system was found as the most cost-effective and suitable conversion method. Eligible incremental capital and operating costs for each enterprise has been determined on the basis of a conversion cost structure relevant to hydrocarbon/water blown (CO2) technology and subsequently approved by the Multilateral Fund Executive Committee. The second component is supporting policies and regulations and technical assistance activities. This component will provide technical assistance to the government agencies and involved beneficiaries and stakeholders to: (a) implement an import quota system to curb the supply of HCFCs; (b) recommend the government authorities not to issue licenses for establishing new facilities and expanding existing facilities using HCFCs; (c) ban the import of bulk HCFC-141b by January 1, 2015 through the HCFC quota system; and (d) support workshops and training, awareness campaigns, and consultants' services (including studies) on the need to phase out HCFCs and on future regulatory measures. The third component is project management. A project management unit ('PMU'), under Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE), will be established and financed to implement and coordinate project implementation and to assist MONRE to put in place regulations and sector specific policies." }, "project_name" : "Vietnam-HCFC Phase-out Project (Phase I)", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report

The funding level of the Program is not sufficient to improve, in absolute terms, the road network condition on the National Road Network as a whole. In this context, the Program is expected to ensure that the condition of the National Road Network remains a given threshold, as reflected in the key results. Such results are deemed to be the best achievable outcome at network level when compared not only to the past declining trend shown but also to counterfactual situation prevailing in the absence of support to the Program. The Program will be implemented by: (a) the Road Department of the ministry of transport and public works, and (b) the Uruguay Road Corporation. The CVU (Corporacion Vial del Uruguay - Uruguay Road Corporation) is linked to the MTOP (Ministerio de Transporte y Obras Publicas -  Ministry of Transport and Public Works) through: (a) a concession agreement, making CVU responsible for managing part of Uruguay's main road network, including highway maintenance, rehabilitation, and, as needed, development; and (b) a technical assistance agreement, through which DNV provides technical and administrative support to CVU. The Program is implemented through contracts to the private sector (road and bridge rehabilitation, performance-based rehabilitation, maintenance or performance-based maintenance) or through routine maintenance works executed by DNV (Direccion Nacional de Vialidad - Road DepartmenT) directly. Usually, except for bridge rehabilitation and reconstruction (design-build contracts), design and supervision functions required by Program-related activities are carried out by DNV staff." },

This component will support integrated adaptation projects to be implemented in four pilot Municipalities (Juigalpa, Murra, San Ramon and San Juan de Limay). The diversity of the local conditions will ensure that the implementation of the adaptation activities in these pilot areas generates lessons learned that can be replicated on a broader scale through subsequent adaptation investments. The second component of the project is coastal wetland protection and reduction of vulnerability to the sea level rise in the Municipality of Corn Island. This component will support the activities in the Atlantic Coast region of Nicaragua, specifically in the Corn Island pilot Municipality. The third component of the project is institutional strengthening, project management and monitoring.

The Government of Colombia has requested a DPL for US$200 million. The First DPL for US$300 million, approved by the Board in July 2011, supported the legislative approval of several important fiscal reforms. Building on the progress achieved under DPL I, this program document is the second DPL supporting the sustained implementation of these reforms. The request underscores the Government's continued interest in engaging with the World Bank to support its efforts in improving fiscal management. The fiscal reform program supported by the loan series seeks to enhance fiscal sustainability and strengthen growth resilience. The program includes a series of measures that can be grouped along three main policy reform areas: (a) budget predictability and stability, (b) social security liability management, and (c) disaster risk financing. The first area includes the implementation of a fiscal rule and a tax reform. The second area covers important legal and regulatory changes to the health insurance system, including the update of the mandatory benefit package and the creation of a contingency fund. The final area includes the development of a national disaster financing strategy and measures to enhance agricultural insurance coverage within a holistic agricultural risk management strategy. The Government of Colombia has made substantial progress in implementing its ambitious fiscal reform program. During the first half of the Presidential term, Congress approved a series of major fiscal reforms, including: a fiscal rule, a reform of the royalties system, a fiscal sustainability constitutional change, tax reforms, and a health law. As detailed in this document, the Government has made good progress in implementing this legislative agenda. The Bank is committed to a long-term engagement in support of the Government's fiscal reform program. The operation is fully consistent with the Bank's business model in Colombia, which emphasizes a strategic and integrated client engagement in support of selected development outcomes through three main lines of business, including financial, knowledge and convening services." }, "project_name" : "Second  Programmatic Fiscal Sustainability and Growth Resilience Development Policy Loan", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081d0cab9_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081d0cab9_1_0", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b08180f40f_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08180f40f_1_0", "DocDate" : "15-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "LA", "EntityID" : "090224b08180cde5_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08180cde5_1_0", "DocDate" : "04-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130124114454", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130124114454", "DocDate" : "11-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121024005756", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121024005756", "DocDate" : "11-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120917114436", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120917114436", "DocDate" : "17-SEP-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130125111205", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130125111205", "DocDate" : "23-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120521103606", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120521103606", "DocDate" : "15-MAY-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Non-compulsory pensions and insurance" }, { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "Compulsory health finance" }, { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Non-compulsory pensions and insurance", "Percent" : 36 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 29 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Compulsory health finance", "Percent" : 28 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "Percent" : 7 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Non-compulsory pensions and insurance", "code" : "FD" }, { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "Compulsory health finance", "code" : "BK" }, { "name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "code" : "AZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AZ,BK,BC,FD", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Macroeconomic management", "Percent" : 21 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Macroeconomic management", "code" : "23" }, { "name" : "Debt management and fiscal sustainability", "code" : "21" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Tax policy and administration", "code" : "28" }, { "name" : "Natural disaster management", "code" : "52" } ], "themecode" : "52,28,27,21,23", "totalamt" : 200000000, "totalcommamt" : 200000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P129465/second-programmatic-fiscal-sustainability-growth-resilience-development-policy-loan?lang=en" }

This DPL for US$260 million is to be implemented as a single operation with a Deferred Drawdown Option (DDO). Uruguay recorded a strong macro economic performance over the past nine years. Real gross domestic product (GDP) growth averaged more than 5 percent per year in the period the 2002 debt crisis. The year 2011 was the ninth consecutive year of GDP growth, marking one of the longest growth periods in the country's history. Prudent macroeconomic policies, improvements in structural areas and favorable external economic conditions, such as buoyant demand for its main export products and a booming regional economy, have contributed to the strong economic performance of Uruguay and helped protect the economy during the 2008/2009 crisis. Private consumption continues to be the main driver of the economy. As in previous years, with the exception of 2009, when GDP growth was driven by the external sector, private consumption was the main driver of economic growth.

Vietnam is one of the country's most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Over the past 50 years, Vietnam has experienced a 20-cm rise in sea level and a 0.5°C increase in average temperature. Natural disasters already result in annual economic losses equivalent to 1.5 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and there are serious concerns about meeting projected water uses. Recognizing the challenges posed by climate change impacts as well as by the need to shift the economy toward lower carbon emission, the GoV has demonstrated significant commitments to a stronger policy and institutional framework to respond to climate change across sectors. These commitments are specifically reflected in the GoV's Support Program to Respond to Climate Change (SP-RCC). This national policy and institutional reform program follows annual policy matrixes developed jointly with development partners and approved by the Prime Minister. The World Bank-financed climate change Development Policy Operation (DPO) programmatic series supports the implementation of the SP-RCC and is arranged under three pillars and four goals. The series is designed to support the GoV to define priorities and targets suitable for each stage of development through three annual programmatic operations.

There are two components to the project. The first component is infrastructure investments in urban regeneration of Tskaltubo and tourism circuits' development. A first component includes the following sub-components: 1) urban regeneration of Tskaltubo. An integrated approach for the urban renewal of Tskaltubo city: this includes a) rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure and utilities in the central area; b) upgrading of public spaces, parks, and construction of tourism amenities, and c) restoration of public buildings with vernacular architecture. The activities will help improve livability and hospitality in a culturally-informed manner, enhance attractiveness for visitors, revitalize the urban nucleus, and attract increased volume of private sector investments around the medical and spa tourism cluster. 2) tourism circuits development: an integrated approach to site upgrading and improved management of the six most attractive cultural heritage sites in Imereti: including Gelati Monastery; Vani Museum and surrounding archaeological site; the Ubisa Church; the Katskhi Church, the Katskhi Column Monastery, and the Motsameta Monastery. This includes a) improving urban landscaping and public parking; b) construction of information kiosks and public toilets; c) restoration and refurbishing of the exterior and interior of the Vani Museum; d) improving access roads; and e) preservation of selected cultural heritage sites. The second component is institutional development. The second component includes the following sub-components. 1) establishment of Tskaltubo destination management and development office: this will create the institutional framework to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all assets that will be constructed/rehabilitated in Tskaltubo, and conduct marketing and promotion activities for the Imereti region; 2) sustainable tourism development and promotion: this will promote Imereti as a new sustainable tourism destination and create a mechanism for community participation, stakeholder consultations, and involvement of local government in the region's tourism development; 3) preparation of visitor management plans for the sustainability of the project's cultural heritage sites; 4) skilled workforce development and capacity building: this will provide demand-driven capacity building training activities to three groups in order to establish a targeted, integrated workforce development program in tourism-related businesses in the Imereti region; 5) performance monitoring and evaluation; and 6) construction supervision support: this will provide Municipal Development Fund (MDF) with construction supervision from an international consulting firm." }, "project_name" : "Second Regional Development Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PROP", "EntityID" :

This program document presents a Competitiveness Development Policy Operation (DPO) for an amount of US$30 million. This is a single operation supporting the efforts of the Government of the Republic of Moldova to enhance growth through export competitiveness and increased access to finance. The Government's program for the period 2011-2014 represents a transition from the stabilization and recovery agenda to establishing a strong basis for growth driven by investment, innovation and competitiveness. The operation builds on and deepens the growth and trade-oriented structural reform agenda started under the economic recovery development policy operation, which was approved by the Board of Executive Directors on June 24, 2010. The Government of the Republic of Moldova has an opportunity to implement reforms that would put the economy on a more sustainable export-led growth path. Emerging from the global economic crisis, Moldova's economic growth resumed swiftly in 2010 and 2011; however, the current Euro area crisis is likely to result in a slowdown of growth in 2012 and in the medium term. Moreover, despite the recovery in 2010 and 2011, job creation remained weak. The main driver of growth in 2010-2011 was private consumption, suggesting that the economy could be returning to the pre-crisis pattern of growth. Before the crisis, a decade of growth with weak job creation created a vicious cycle of migration, remittances, exchange rate appreciation, declines in tradable sectors, joblessness, and thus more migration. Heavy reliance on remittance-funded consumption and housing construction leaves the economy vulnerable to changes in the external environment and undermines Moldova's long-term competitiveness. The operation addresses binding constraints to economic growth by improving the returns to private investment and reducing the costs of finance." }, "project_name" : "Competitiveness Developmenet Policy Operation", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000445729_20130704123420", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000445729_20130704123420", "DocDate" : "01-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121010011504", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121010011504", "DocDate" : "02-OCT-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Europe and Central Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "General finance sector" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "Other domestic and international trade" }, { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "General finance sector", "Percent" : 30 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 30 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Other domestic and international trade", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "General finance sector", "code" : "FZ" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "Other domestic and international trade", "code" : "YY" }, { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "code" : "AZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "AZ,BZ,YY,YZ,FZ", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "Percent" : 30 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Rural policies and institutions", "code" : "77" }, { "name" : "Export development and competitiveness", "code" : "45" }, { "name" : "Regional integration", "code" : "47" } ], "themecode" : "47,45,77,40", "totalamt" : 30000000, "totalcommamt" : 30000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122226/competitiveness-developmenet-policy-operation?lang=en" }

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide a pre arrears clearance grant in the amount of SDR52.6 million (US$80 million equivalent) to the project. Myanmar is one of the poorest countries in the East Asia and Pacific Region, with an estimated gross domestic product per capita of between US$500-800. While reliable poverty data are scarce in Myanmar, all indicators point to poverty being concentrated in rural areas: two rounds of household surveys (in 2005 and 2009) supported by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) highlight significant differences in poverty across geographical areas, with rural poverty considerably higher than urban poverty. Available figures also suggest that social indicators are poor; with for example 32 percent of children under five suffering from malnutrition, the highest rate in the region. Agriculture is the mainstay of the national economy, generating 43 percent of gross domestic product, 54 percent of employment and providing livelihoods to more that 70 percent of the population. However, the sector is characterized by a number of constraints, including limited irrigation; little value added agro processing capacity, poor policy settings, and widespread indebtedness in rural communities. Fundamental to the triple transition is a 'paradigm shift' to a 'people-centered approach,' as articulated by President Thein Sein. This encompasses greater attention to the delivery of services, a greater proportion of government budget to health and education, and a shift from 'top-down' to 'bottom-up' planning. This shift holds out the promise of change in state-society relations, following a half century of rule by successive military governments. The project will support this paradigm shift and 'people-centered' development by enabling poor rural communities to lead the identification of needs and implementation of activities aimed at promoting access to basic services and rural infrastructure. This will both empower communities and allow the government to deliver visible results of reform at the community level. In addition, the project will engender more constructive relationships between government and communities, and will support rural poverty alleviation, a stated objective of the government's economic reforms. If successful, the project, which will be implemented in 15 of Myanmar's 330 townships, can be scaled up across the country." }, "project_name" : "Myanmar National Community Driven Development

The PDPG6 of SDR 13.2 million (US$ 20 million equivalent) is the third in a programmatic series of three operations for the Republic of Tajikistan. The PDPG4-6 series is central to the World Bank's engagement in Tajikistan, as envisaged in the FY10-13 Country Partnership Strategy (CPS). It supports the government's two-pronged strategy to mitigate the impact of the global crisis and to pave the way for post-crisis recovery and poverty reduction. The series builds on the PDPG1-3 series completed in 2009, and seeks to (i) protect social spending and increase its efficiency, (ii) improve the climate for private sector development, and (iii) strengthen government effectiveness. PDPG4 and PDPG5 focused on protecting earlier social sectors gains, and on improving the environment for private investment. The 2008-09 global economic crisis adversely affected Tajikistan through lower remittances and exports. Growth slowed to 3.9 percent, PDPG6 supports the economic recovery underway following the 2009 slowdown. Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth has recovered to more than 6 percent in 2010 and 2011. Accordingly, the focus of the PDPG series has shifted from protecting earlier social sector gains to improving the environment for private sector development and strengthening government effectiveness. PDPG6 supports continued implementation of health and education financing reforms and ongoing efforts to improve targeting effectiveness of social assistance. To help spur private sector-led growth, the government has submitted a new law on public private partnerships to Parliament in August 2012, and has continued expedited issuance of land-use certificates to farmers. It has introduced a new salary grid in all central government entities, submitted a new law on public administration to Parliament which was approved in May 2012, approved the chart of accounts for public institutions, and prepared the 2012 budget based on the new budget classification." }, "project_name" : "Tajikistan PDPG6", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b08191e3d0_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b08191e3d0_1_0", "DocDate" : "13-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0817c056c_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817c056c_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121012012433", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121012012433", "DocDate" : "30-SEP-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20121022160942", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20121022160942", "DocDate" : "21-SEP-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120404124925", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120404124925", "DocDate" : "03-APR-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Europe and Central Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "General public administration sector" }, { "Name" : "Energy efficiency in Heat and Power" }, { "Name" : "Compulsory health finance" }, { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "General public administration sector", "Percent" : 50 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Energy efficiency in Heat and Power", "Percent" : 17 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Compulsory health finance", "Percent" : 11 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "Percent" : 11 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "General public administration sector", "code" : "BZ" }, { "name" : "Energy efficiency in Heat and Power", "code" : "LA" }, { "name" : "Compulsory health finance", "code" : "BK" }, { "name" : "General agriculture, fishing and forestry sector", "code" : "AZ" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "YZ,AZ,BK,LA,BZ", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Health system performance", "Percent" : 11 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Health system performance", "code" : "67" }, { "name" : "Other rural development", "code" : "79" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Administrative and civil service reform", "code" : "25" } ], "themecode" : "25,27,79,67", "totalamt" : 20000000, "totalcommamt" : 20000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P126042/tajikistan-pdpg6?lang=en" }

Subcomponent (a) will provide support for a comprehensive review of the legal and regulatory framework on pollution management, including reviewing and revising laws, regulations, and other legal documents at central and provincial levels. Subcomponent (b) will support the development of environmental monitoring infrastructure and the improvement in environmental enforcement activities, including: (i) acquisition of testing laboratory equipment, standard samples, monitoring equipment, protection gears, and vehicles; (ii) acquisition and installation of automatic water quality monitoring stations; (iii) monitoring of surface water quality, Industrial zone (IZ) wastewater discharge, and inspection and enforcement; and (iv) development and upgrade of the environmental monitoring information management systems of Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and the project provinces. Subcomponent (c) will support the development of an industrial pollution information disclosure system, including: (i) development of an environmental performance rating methodology; (ii) disclosure of environmental monitoring, enforcement results, and public complaint records on a website; (iii) maintenance of close communication with Centralized Effluent Treatment Plant (CETP) investors to enable them to understand the rating system and ways to improve their ratings; (iv) disclosure of final performance ratings through various media outlets; (v) awareness raising activities and dissemination of relevant informational materials; and (vi) facilitation of communication with various media outlets. The second component is performance-based CETP financing. This component will provide performance-based loans to finance the construction of new CETPs, the expansion of existing CETPs, and the improvement of other relevant infrastructure of industrial wastewater management in the industrial zones of the project provinces. The third component is implementation support.

The growth outlook for Tanzania continues to remain optimistic, although there are certain risks. The economy is estimated to grow by 6.8 percent in 2012, slightly lower than the previous year. The medium term growth outlook remains positive. Achieving a buoyant outlook is dependent on addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, structural reforms, and carrying out sound public finance policy and public financial management. However, this remains vulnerable to domestic and external shocks including the Euro zone debt crisis. The level of foreign aid is already projected to decline significantly in FY2012/13. Fiscal consolidation for the central government is on track and is in line with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) policy support instrument program. The budget framework for 2012/13 is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), closer to the level before the global financial crisis. The latest debt sustainability analysis (June 2012) shows that Tanzania's risk of debt stress remains low but is sensitive to borrowing terms and the government's fiscal position. Given the uncertainties in the external environment and the public investments through parastatals, Tanzania needs to manage its fiscal and debt sustainability. In 2004, Government of Tanzania (GoT) introduced the Local Government Capital Development Grant (LGCDG) as a grant flow to local governments. Prior to the introduction of the LGCDG, direct development grants to Local Government Authority (LGAs) were minimal and not performance based. LGAs received certain additional development resources from sectoral development programs and from area-based development programs. The LGCDG has evolved into the Local Government Development Grant (LGDG) program with several sub-programs and has become a mainstream performance based fiscal transfer. By introducing LGDG the government program the Government created a formula-based, transparent and predictable fiscal flow mechanism to disburse funds to all 133 LGAs in the country, on the basis of the institutional performance achieved. The main thrust of the LGDG system is to incentivize the improved institutional performance of LGAs while providing discretionary and sector-specific funding for development purposes. The LGDG system's chief goal is to improve the overall, long-term functioning of the local government system in Tanzania, so as to improve the quality of investments. More specifically, its objectives are to:1) enhance the delivery and management capabilities, productive efficiencies and financial sustainability of local governments; 2) improve access of communities especially the poor, to local services through expanding the physical stock of new and rehabilitated infrastructure; 3) improve the sustainability of local development infrastructure through ensuring proper planning and adequate operations and maintenance (O&M); and 4) provide a national system for the delivery of development grants to LGAs." }, "project_name" : "Urban Local Government Strengthening Program", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "000333037_20130418111729", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20130418111729", "DocDate" : "16-APR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000350881_20121012110752", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20121012110752", "DocDate" : "10-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120907135604", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120907135604", "DocDate" : "06-SEP-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "WP", "EntityID" : "000356161_20121205004440", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121205004440", "DocDate" : "24-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Working Paper (WP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "WP", "EntityID" : "000356161_20121205004153", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20121205004153", "DocDate" : "24-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 5", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20120829004358", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120829004358", "DocDate" : "22-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 5", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20120829005349", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120829005349", "DocDate" : "22-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000020953_20120717110930", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000020953_20120717110930", "DocDate" : "07-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.5 of 5", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120720033713", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120720033713", "DocDate" : "21-JUN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.4 of 5", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120720033450", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120720033450", "DocDate" : "15-JUN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.3 of 5", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000356161_20120720024705", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20120720024705", "DocDate" : "15-JUN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000003596_20110324085804", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20110324085804", "DocDate" : "09-MAR-2011" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000003596_20110215095809", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000003596_20110215095809", "DocDate" : "20-JAN-2011" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Sub-national government administration", "code" : "BH" } ], "sectorcode" : "BH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Municipal governance and institution building", "Percent" : 40 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Municipal governance and institution building", "code" : "73" }, { "name" : "Decentralization", "code" : "26" } ], "themecode" : "26,73", "totalamt" : 255000000, "totalcommamt" : 255000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P118152/tanzania-second-local-government-support-project?lang=en" }

The main change introduced is the revision of the monitoring indicators (excluding project development objective, or PDO-related indicators) and targets. Specifically, some indicators have been revised to better capture project outcomes and the target values for components 1 and 2 have been modified to reflect the scaling-up of project activities. Target values for component 3 have been fully achieved during implementation of the Parent Project (PP) and are not being modified since this component will not be scaled-up.  The AF will support the scale up of two of the three components (components 1 and 2). All components have met their targets; the decision to scale up only activities under components 1 (La Paz) and 2 (El Alto) is based on the Borrower's decision to prioritize investments in the poorer areas of the country. The AF will extend the closing date of the PP to October 31, 2015.

This project paper seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to provide an additional credit in an amount of SDR16.5 million (US$25 million equivalent) to the project. This will be the project's first Additional Financing (AF). The AF will support the scale up of an agricultural input subsidy which has successfully contributed to the expansion of maize and rice production in the country, the improvement of national food security, and the withdrawal of an export ban on grains trade. Specifically, the AF will finance a 30 percent increase in the number of farmers receiving input subsidies during the 2012/13 cropping season. This expansion in program coverage is critically important in the context of high international fertilizer prices, and rising international grain prices. The funding will help Tanzania maintain self-sufficiency on grain production. The Government of the United Republic of Tanzania (GoT) has requested continuing International Development Association (IDA) support for its input subsidy program. This was anticipated in the Tanzania Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), with the expectation that the commitment would be defined within the next phase of the Agricultural Sector Development Project (ASDP). However, the development of this commitment has been postponed to allow for a more strategic review of sectoral coordination and performance. The new ASDP funding is now only expected to be available in late 2013. The AF will support the maintenance of the subsidy program during the 2012/13 gap year." }, "project_name" : "Accelerated Food Security Project Additional Financing", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Paper (PJPR),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PJPR", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121008011809", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121008011809", "DocDate" : "02-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120913094252", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120913094252", "DocDate" : "08-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.2 of 2", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029013545", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029013545", "DocDate" : "01-MAR-2009" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 2", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333038_20121029012430", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20121029012430", "DocDate" : "01-AUG-2005" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Crops" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Crops", "Percent" : 100 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Crops", "code" : "AH" } ], "sectorcode" : "AH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "Y", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Global food crisis response", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Global food crisis response", "code" : "91" }, { "name" : "Other rural development", "code" : "79" } ], "themecode" : "79,91", "totalamt" : 25000000, "totalcommamt" : 25000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P132780/accelerated-food-security-project-additional-financing?lang=en" }

There are three components to the project. The first component is rural infrastructure. The focus of this component is to connect the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production potential through improved availability of irrigation. The second component is community, marketing and productive infrastructure. This component will cover investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-level infrastructure, and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity. The third component is project management and institutional strengthening. This component supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions of the project.

The DPC2 is aligned with World Bank's strategic directions set out in the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY11-14). The main risks are: (a) aggregate demand pressures could linger resulting in persistent rupee shortage. Mitigating factors include: recent monetary and fiscal tightening; a calibration of capital spending by the Royal Government of Bhutan, or RGoB based on foreign grants or loans; and commitment at high levels of the RGoB (in close coordination between Ministry of Finance, the Royal Monetary Authority, in consultation with the World Bank) to targets as evidenced by quarterly review of macroeconomic performance. The expansion of the existing line of credit with the Government of India as well as the currency swap arrangement should help ease pressures on the rupee; (b) capacity constraints due to the small scale of government, mitigated by the RGoB's ongoing capacity building efforts (in many areas supported by development partners); and (c) political risk of changing government priorities, mitigated by the RGoB's wide consultations on the development agenda and its commitment to sustaining reforms." }, "project_name" : "BT:  DPC 2", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0817a7399_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0817a7399_1_0", "DocDate" : "13-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000333037_20120912001127", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120912001127", "DocDate" : "27-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120725095348", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120725095348", "DocDate" : "20-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20120525102728", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20120525102728", "DocDate" : "23-MAY-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "South Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" }, { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration" }, { "Name" : "General transportation sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 38 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector", "Percent" : 38 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration", "Percent" : 12 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "General transportation sector", "Percent" : 12 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" }, { "name" : "Sub-national government administration", "code" : "BH" }, { "name" : "General transportation sector", "code" : "TZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "TZ,BH,YZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "Percent" : 15 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Regulation and competition policy", "code" : "40" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "International financial standards and systems", "code" : "42" }, { "name" : "Natural disaster management", "code" : "52" }, { "name" : "Improving labor markets", "code" : "51" } ], "themecode" : "51,52,42,27,40", "totalamt" : 36000000, "totalcommamt" : 36000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P128201/bt-dpc-2?lang=en" }

There are five components to the project. The first component is Panchayat Sarkar Bhawan. This component involves construction and making functional Panchayat Sarkar Bhawans in approximately 300 gram panchayats. The second component is capacity building for Panchayat Raj Institutions. This component builds panchayats' core institutional competencies to empower them to achieve substantive development outcomes. The component also engages communities and citizens, through training, mobilization, and media, to participate in local governance and to hold panchayats accountable. The third component is strengthening the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. This component will strengthen the state government capacity to manage a gradual decentralization and empowerment process. The fourth component is panchayat performance grant. The annual best panchayat grant will reward exceptional panchayats that are inclusive, responsive and accountable. The recipients of the grant will be selected on a competitive basis. The competition criteria will include core institutional quality indicators related to how a panchayat runs its administration, how it interacts with its citizens, and how it manages resources and promotes local development. The competition will be based on objective information collected through the project information system with a validation process. Annually, the project will recognize the best gram panchayat in each district and block, and award them block grants, which are significantly higher than what they currently receive. The project will support this league of good panchayats to develop high impact initiatives that the grants will finance. The fifth component is project management and coordination. Government of Bihar (GoB) has established a Bihar Gram Swaraj Yojana Society (BGSYS) as the implementation agency for the project.

There are three components to the project. The first component is facilitating access to mineral resources. This component will focus on supporting the Government of Guinea (GoG) in developing the capacities and systems to facilitate negotiation and contracting with private sector mining companies including mining ancillary infrastructure. It will further strengthen the governance and institutional structure of Societe Guineenne du Patrimoine Minier (State-Owned Guinean Mining Company) (SOUGIPAMI) and its technical, legal, and financial capacities to engage with mining projects sponsors. The second component is institutional strengthening for mineral management. This component will focus on strengthening the GoG capacities to license, control and monitor technical, environmental, and financial compliance of mining operations. The third component is promoting economic development of mining areas and good governance. This component will focus on sustainable investments. This will include the facilitation of regional and local development plans through partnerships with the private sector, and the strengthening of mechanisms for demand for good governance (DFG). This component will have a regional aspect, in that it will most likely focus on at least one 'growth corridor,' (iron-ore in the South-East or Bauxite/Alumina in the North-West). It will build on work carried out under previous studies, and seek synergies with International Finance Corporation (IFC) and other donor activities. The fourth component is project management. This component will support the project implementation unit, based in the Ministry of Mines, in the management of fiduciary activities, project monitoring and evaluation and the implementation of activities." }, "project_name" : "Mineral Governance Support Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b082042c03_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b082042c03_1_0", "DocDate" : "06-NOV-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b0819628fb_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0819628fb_1_0", "DocDate" : "26-FEB-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Disbursement Letter (Disbursement Letter),  Vol.", "DocType" : "Disbursement Letter", "EntityID" : "090224b081bbe52d_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081bbe52d_1_0", "DocDate" : "19-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b081bbe4b9_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081bbe4b9_1_0", "DocDate" : "19-JAN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120910010000", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120910010000", "DocDate" : "21-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012081013195384", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012081013195384", "DocDate" : "10-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012081016203317", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012081016203317", "DocDate" : "10-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120814022924", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120814022924", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Agreement (AGR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "AGR", "EntityID" : "000171540_2012061910035756", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000171540_2012061910035756", "DocDate" : "15-MAY-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol.", "DocType" : "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012011713245043", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012011713245043", "DocDate" : "17-JAN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012011213375735", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012011213375735", "DocDate" : "12-JAN-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "Africa", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Public administration- Energy and mining" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation" }, { "Name" : "Other Mining and Extractive Industries" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Energy and mining", "Percent" : 88 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "Percent" : 6 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Other Mining and Extractive Industries", "Percent" : 6 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Public administration- Energy and mining", "code" : "BU" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Transportation", "code" : "BV" }, { "name" : "Other Mining and Extractive Industries", "code" : "LS" } ], "sectorcode" : "LS,BV,BU", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Environmental policies and institutions", "Percent" : 12 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Environmental policies and institutions", "code" : "82" }, { "name" : "Other public sector governance", "code" : "30" }, { "name" : "Participation and civic engagement", "code" : "57" }, { "name" : "Land administration and management", "code" : "83" } ], "themecode" : "83,57,30,82", "totalamt" : 20000000, "totalcommamt" : 20000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P122916/mineral-governance-support-project?lang=en" }

Furthermore, the project will contribute to raising public awareness and education standards in forestry issues in general, with specific reference to forest fires prevention/control and forest governance issues. There are three components to the project. The first component of the project is enhancing forest fire prevention, management, and control. This component aims to improve the effectiveness of forest fire prevention and management by: (i) improving the capacity for early detection and quick response to fight forest fires, and (ii) reducing the number of fires of human origin through awareness raising and environmental education programs. Early fire detection is recognized as a key element in improving protection of forests from fires. Fire prevention and environmental education will be focused on children and youth as a means to encourage long-term behavior change. The second component of the project is building forestry and Protected Area (PA) management capacity. This component will increase forest and PA management capacity and help address key policy and management issues that either create perverse incentives or exacerbate conditions contributing to the extent and intensity of fires in the extensive forest landscape and protected areas. The third component of the project is project management will finance the operating costs of a Project Implementation Unit (PIU), which will undertake project management functions for both components one and two. The PIU will provide support to the core implementing agencies (Federal Forestry Agency (FFA) and Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MNRE)) in project management, including procurement, financial management, project coordination, reporting, and monitoring. The PIU has been selected on a competitive basis by a committee formed by the implementing agencies, the Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Economic Development.

The government greatly values the technical assistance and policy dialogue that the bank can provide through its DPLs. Technical assistance in this program will be funded partly by reimbursable technical assistance.

There are three components to the project. The first component is road rehabilitation. This component will finance the rehabilitation and upgrading of the M-03 road between Lubny and Poltava. The civil works to be funded from the loan will cover about 108km. The M-03 road connects the industrial areas in eastern Ukraine to Kiev, and is also part of the European road corridor E-40. Physical works will include the rehabilitation of the existing 4-lane road sections and the widening of other sections from two to four lanes, to ensure that the entire road is in line with the Ukrainian motorway standard. In addition to the increase in road capacity and the improvement of road conditions, this component will result in major road safety benefits. Widening to four lanes will greatly reduce the risk of head-on collisions, which are today the main cause of crashes and traffic fatalities of this road. The second component is road safety improvements. This component will finance two types of activities: (i) safety improvements along several high risk road corridors; and (ii) introduction of improved road safety features on the existing M-03 sections in urbanized areas which will remain even after bypasses will be built around those under component one. For the former, a comprehensive road safety assessment is being carried out under the ongoing RSIP, using the risk mapping and star rating approach of the International Road Assessment Program (IRAP). The third component is institutional support and strengthening. Under this component the Bank will complement the institutional assistance already being provided by other development partners, in support of the Government's concept for the road sector reform program enacted through the Cabinet of Ministers dated August 3, 2011. This component will support: (i) the development of a strategic program for road sector development until 2030; and (ii) the enhancement of the capacity of Ukravtodor, the Ukrainian State Institute for Design of Roads (Ukrdiprodor) and other Ukrainian institutions, for designing and building safer roads.

The component will build on the success of Bangladeshi NGOs in the areas of community outreach in total sanitation programs. The third component of the project is energy efficient lighting. This component will support the distribution of 7.25 million Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs) in predominantly rural areas where these energy efficient CFLs are not yet widely used.

There are three components to the project. The first component is performance grant. This component focuses on two areas of urban governance: resource planning and management, seeking to improve decision making, consolidate revenue sources and strengthen resource mobilization; and transparency and voice in the preparation, monitoring and evaluation of plans and programs in urban areas. This component will provide an annual grant to the project cities, based on achievement of specified annual targets against a set of Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs) in selected governance areas. The second component is project implementation and capacity building. This component supports the cities and province through technical assistance and capacity building to achieve the DLIs and enhancement in revenue. The Urban Sector Planning and Management Services Unit (USPMSU), and a City Program Unit (CPU) in each of the five cities will be responsible for providing this support and the corresponding costs will be financed from this component. The third component is contingent emergency response. This component will support preparedness and rapid response to disaster, emergency, and/or catastrophic events, as needed. The provisional zero cost for this component will allow for rapid reallocation of credit proceeds from other components under streamlined procurement and disbursement procedures. This component could also be used to channel additional funds should they become available as a result of the emergency." }, "project_name" : "PK: Punjab Cities Governance Improvement", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081c5b93f_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081c5b93f_1_0", "DocDate" : "12-JUN-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081837df2_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081837df2_1_0", "DocDate" : "23-DEC-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012091007443799", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012091007443799", "DocDate" : "07-SEP-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Appraisal Document (PAD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PAD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120819235216", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120819235216", "DocDate" : "08-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Procurement Plan (PROP),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PROP", "EntityID" : "000356161_20130805105744", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000356161_20130805105744", "DocDate" : "23-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET),  Vol.", "DocType" : "INTEGRATED SAFEGUARDS DATA SHEET", "EntityID" : "0000A8056_2012071018041365", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=0000A8056_2012071018041365", "DocDate" : "10-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Environmental Assessment (EA),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "EA", "EntityID" : "000333037_20120723023016", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120723023016", "DocDate" : "01-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Integrated Safeguards Data Sheet (ISDS),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "ISDS", "EntityID" : "000104615_20090904102701", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090904102701", "DocDate" : "02-SEP-2009" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Project Information Document (PID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PID", "EntityID" : "000104615_20090821104732", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000104615_20090821104732", "DocDate" : "08-JUN-2009" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Active", "regionname" : "South Asia", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration" }, { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration", "Percent" : 90 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "Percent" : 10 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Sub-national government administration", "code" : "BH" }, { "name" : "Public administration- Information and communications", "code" : "BM" } ], "sectorcode" : "BM,BH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Active", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Municipal finance", "Percent" : 34 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Municipal finance", "code" : "72" }, { "name" : "Municipal governance and institution building", "code" : "73" } ], "themecode" : "73,72", "totalamt" : 150000000, "totalcommamt" : 150000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P112901/pk-punjab-large-cities-project?lang=en" }

The Project will provide US$25 million to support IIGF in issuing its own IIGF guarantees for qualifying projects. Qualifying projects will be those which are apprised by the WB and meet WB policies as well as other reputational risk considerations. In order to prevent the mingling of this $25 million with IIGF capital, the WB loan proceeds under component one will be disbursed at the time a claim is properly made and assessed as payable by IIGF with respect to an IIGF guarantee for a WB-Supported IIGF-project. The second component of the project is technical assistance (TA).

There are three components to the project. The first component is system expansion and reinforcement. This component will cover construction and reinforcement of 110 kV, Medium Voltage (MV) and Low Voltage (LV) electricity distribution networks, including substations, of the PCs. These investments will help the PCs to efficiently meet load growth, address load supply constraints due to distribution system congestion, reduce losses, and improve reliability and quality of power supply. The second component is introduction of smart grid technologies in distribution. This component, which includes Clean Technology Fund (CTF) co-financing, will focus on (i) automation, through introduction of supervisory control and data acquisition systems, of electricity distribution network operations of and data collection by the PCs; and (ii) introduction of Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems, including two-way communication systems, as electricity distribution smart grid technologies for key substations and consumers of selected PCs. Supporting the first stage of the roadmap for smart grid technologies for power distribution in Vietnam, the component will assist to increase efficiency, reliability and effectiveness of the PCs' systems and operations, and optimize distribution system configuration by providing real time data from both the supply and the demand side. The third component is technical assistance and capacity building. Provision of technical assistance to and capacity building of Electricity Regulatory Authority of Vietnam (ERAV) for improvement of efficiency in electricity tariffs, enhancement of efficiency of and incorporation of smart grid technologies in the grid and distribution codes, integration of renewable energy in the grid and distribution codes, development of demand response and smart grid programs, and project management and monitoring and evaluation. Building on the technical assistance and capacity building under on-going Bank projects and the Bank support to power sector reform and tariff regulation, third component will complement the investment in the previous two components through building capacity and implementing arrangements to maximize improvements in PCs' efficiency and achieve reductions in demand compared to Business as usual (BAU), to achieve project development objectives and indicators." }, "project_name" : "Distribution Efficiency Project", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results

The second component is community mobilization and Behavior Change Communication (BCC). This component will strengthen the supply and demand-side interface of the ICDS program, especially at the point of delivery of nutrition services, and will rigorously monitor and evaluate this interface. The component will focus on excluded and marginalized groups. The development of a management model that emphasizes efficiency on the basis of mutual accountability between caregivers and beneficiaries will be a significant area of support. The third component is convergent nutrition action. This component will support the Government of India's efforts to initiate, and subsequently expand, a comprehensive convergent nutrition response to complement the ICDS, in order to address the multiple determinants of malnutrition. The fourth component is project management, monitoring and evaluation. This component will support effective project management including: (i) financing specialists in a variety of fields to strengthen the operation of the established Project Management Units (PMUs) at the central and state level. Support will also include financing of office equipment, renting of vehicles, travel costs for key program staff, participation in planning/review/dissemination workshops, participation in study tours and conferences in order to facilitate a cross fertilization of ideas and an assimilation in the program of nutrition related best practices, and incremental operating costs; (ii) financing administrative costs of a technical agency to provide required technical support for program implementation, including the cost of core teams at the central and state levels, their office expenses and travel costs for training and evaluations; and (iii) the monitoring and evaluation of project outcomes, including designing an independent impact evaluation study, carrying out a baseline survey as well as annual rapid assessments on program coverage and behavior change, quarterly internal assessments by ICDS supervisors in randomly selected Anganwadi Centers (AWCs), and social assessments and an ethnographic study in minority and hard to reach areas to assess service delivery and effectiveness of communication outreach.

(2) Producer associations and biodiversity-friendly market initiatives component will strengthen the capacities of producer associations managing biodiversity-friendly production and marketing systems, and improve associations' collaboration capacity with other economic agents of the value chain.

This program document presents a DPL in the amount of US$300 million for the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This DPL is designed to assist the Government of Rio de Janeiro (GORJ) in continuing its efforts to improve fiscal management, social service delivery in health and education, and public financial management. Although requested as a stand-alone DPL, the operation forms part of a long term quasi programmatic engagement with the State. It is the third DPL operation with the state of Rio de Janeiro. The policies supported by this third DPL are part of the GORJ's medium-term reform program and would deepen and extend the areas covered by the first DPL. Specifically, the operation will support measures to: (i) improve the efficiency of tax administration; (ii) improve budgetary management, including screening and evaluation of new public investment projects, better estimating costs of new policy initiatives, and strengthening internal controls; and (iii) increase quality and efficiency of the education system, by introducing merit-based selection processes for school managers, annual school-level performance targets, and performance-linked pay, and in the health system by increasing the efficiency of health spending, both in regional hospitals and smaller municipalities." }, "project_name" : "RIO STATE DEVELOPMENT POLICY LOAN III", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b0819ff8ee_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0819ff8ee_1_0", "DocDate" : "20-MAR-2013" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Implementation Status and Results Report (ISRR),  Vol.", "DocType" : "ISRR", "EntityID" : "090224b081773a0a_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081773a0a_1_0", "DocDate" : "14-NOV-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Loan Agreement (LA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "LA", "EntityID" : "090224b081784bf1_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081784bf1_1_0", "DocDate" : "30-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Guarantee Agreement (GA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "GA", "EntityID" : "090224b081784c0b_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b081784c0b_1_0", "DocDate" : "30-OCT-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333038_20120910010128", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333038_20120910010128", "DocDate" : "30-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000350881_20120828100800", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000350881_20120828100800", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20121109011157", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20121109011157", "DocDate" : "25-JUL-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20120209091036", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20120209091036", "DocDate" : "30-JAN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20110808120608", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20110808120608", "DocDate" : "28-JUL-2011" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IBRD", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "Latin America and Caribbean", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration" }, { "Name" : "General education sector" }, { "Name" : "Health" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Sub-national government administration", "Percent" : 60 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General education sector", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "Health", "Percent" : 20 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Sub-national government administration", "code" : "BH" }, { "name" : "General education sector", "code" : "EZ" }, { "name" : "Health", "code" : "JA" } ], "sectorcode" : "JA,EZ,BH", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Health system performance", "Percent" : 20 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Health system performance", "code" : "67" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Tax policy and administration", "code" : "28" }, { "name" : "Education for all", "code" : "65" } ], "themecode" : "65,28,27,67", "totalamt" : 300000000, "totalcommamt" : 300000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P126465/rio-state-development-policy-loan-iii?lang=en" }

This will enable the country to more effectively translate these revenues into better development outcomes and improved public service delivery. The five policy areas in the new PRSO directly support the strategic objectives of World Bank's new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) of (i) improving competitiveness and connectivity, (ii) sustainable resource management, (iii) inclusive development, and the crosscutting theme of strategic public sector management. Additionally, this third PRSO series builds on lessons learned from the previous second PSRO series. To ensure impact and results from the previously supported reforms, the third PRSO series continues support in some policy areas while aiming to selectively open new fronts of support for reform to meet the country's development challenges that include diversified and inclusive growth. The preparation of the new PRSO series included extensive consultations with all stakeholders, and close cooperation with the European Commission (EC). This PRSO series arrives at a critical time as Lao PDR's economy benefits from abundant natural resources, which, if managed well, may put the country on a sustainable and inclusive medium-term growth path. Lao PDR's forests, agricultural land, water and mineral resources and hydropower potential account for more than half of the country's total wealth. With appropriate macroeconomic and governance policies, the country's natural resource wealth can contribute significantly towards rapid, sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Rapid expansion of the hydropower and mining sectors has benefited the country by contributing towards general economic growth, increasing fiscal revenues significantly, and reducing local poverty and improving infrastructure. It has also promoted change in environmental legislation." }, "project_name" : "Lao Eight Poverty Reduction Support", "projectdocs" : [ { "DocTypeDesc" : "Financing Agreement (FIA),  Vol.", "DocType" : "FIA", "EntityID" : "090224b0816d97b2_1_0", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=090224b0816d97b2_1_0", "DocDate" : "31-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Summary of Discussion (Summary of Discussion),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "Summary of Discussion", "EntityID" : "000333037_20120812234538", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000333037_20120812234538", "DocDate" : "09-AUG-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Document (PGD),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGD", "EntityID" : "000386194_20120720013432", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000386194_20120720013432", "DocDate" : "25-JUN-2012" }, { "DocTypeDesc" : "Program Information Document (PGID),  Vol.1 of 1", "DocType" : "PGID", "EntityID" : "000001843_20120514123353", "DocURL" : "http://www-wds.worldbank.org/servlet/WDSServlet?pcont=details&eid=000001843_20120514123353", "DocDate" : "26-APR-2012" } ], "projectfinancialtype" : "IDA", "projectstatusdisplay" : "Closed", "regionname" : "East Asia and Pacific", "sector" : [ { "Name" : "Central government administration" }, { "Name" : "General finance sector" }, { "Name" : "General education sector" }, { "Name" : "Health" }, { "Name" : "General industry and trade sector" } ], "sector1" : { "Name" : "Central government administration", "Percent" : 36 }, "sector2" : { "Name" : "General finance sector", "Percent" : 29 }, "sector3" : { "Name" : "General education sector", "Percent" : 14 }, "sector4" : { "Name" : "Health", "Percent" : 14 }, "sector_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Central government administration", "code" : "BC" }, { "name" : "General finance sector", "code" : "FZ" }, { "name" : "General education sector", "code" : "EZ" }, { "name" : "Health", "code" : "JA" }, { "name" : "General industry and trade sector", "code" : "YZ" } ], "sectorcode" : "YZ,JA,EZ,FZ,BC", "source" : "IBRD", "status" : "Closed", "supplementprojectflg" : "N", "theme1" : { "Name" : "Child health", "Percent" : 14 }, "theme_namecode" : [ { "name" : "Child health", "code" : "63" }, { "name" : "Trade facilitation and market access", "code" : "49" }, { "name" : "Public expenditure, financial management and procurement", "code" : "27" }, { "name" : "Education for all", "code" : "65" } ], "themecode" : "65,27,49,63", "totalamt" : 20000000, "totalcommamt" : 20000000, "url" : "http://www.worldbank.org/projects/P125298/lao-eight-poverty-reduction-support?lang=en" }

There are three components to the project, the first component being support to Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA) to upgrade the urban road transport infrastructure. This component will involve: constructing and rehabilitating non-motorized transport facilities, including foot paths, cycle tracks, pedestrian bridges and underpasses; and carrying out feasibility and detailed engineering design studies of roads adjoining major towns and studies for improvement of traffic flows through provision of technical advisory services. The second component is the support to Kenya Urban Roads Authority (KURA) and Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to develop selected mass transit corridors. The activities under this component of the project, which include carrying out feasibility studies and detailed engineering designs and preparation of bidding and contract documents for works and associated facilities as well as selection of private sector operators to provide large capacity buses for a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system and rolling stock for a commuter rail system are a precursor for a successor project. Finally, the third component is the institutional strengthening and capacity building. This component will support and deepen the implementation of reforms in the transport sector with a major focus on urban transport." }, "project_name" : "KENYA: NATIONAL URBAN TRANSPORT IMPROVEMENT
